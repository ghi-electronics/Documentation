# Secure Boot
---
TinyCLR OS is designed with security in mind. The system boots up from internal memories that are not accessible externally. The boot code only boots up an authenticated firmware that is provided by GHI Electronics. The user then controls the application and how it is updated though an encrypted [In-Field Update](in-field-update.md) and can also take advantage of the [IP Protection](ip-protection.md) feature.
