# MJPEG Video

---

The MJPEG video format is simply a chain of JPG images that are stored in a single file. Since JPEG is already supported, a developer can present the individual JPEG files.

This is an [example](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Drivers/blob/dev/Media/Mjpeg.cs) of how it is done on SITCore (TinyCLR).
