# 3-pin Modules

---

These modules are very low-cost and made by thousands of companies globally.

The pinout of the three pins is the same one used by the extremely common RC Servo Motors. While the wire coloring may differ, power is always in the middle. It is usually red color. The ground pin is on one of the sides and it is usually black or brown. The signal is the last wire and it is usually yellow or orange.
