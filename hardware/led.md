# Smart LEDs

---

Smart addressable LEDs come in all sort of styles and shapes. They come as ropes, rings and even matrices.

The most commonly used type of addressable LEDs use the WS2811 controller, sometimes referred to as NeoPixel.These controllers allow a single pin to control thousands of LEDs; however, the signaling needed is time critical and not simple to generate.

DUELink fully support WS2811 LEDs allowing for simple to complex LED projects to work. See the [Neo LED API](..\software\api\led.md).
