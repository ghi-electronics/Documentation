Educators now have the power to use their beloved language-of-choice with BrainPad devices, thanks to the power of the DUE platform.

Both BrainPad Pulse and BrainPad Edge are fully supported. However, BrainPad Pulse include additional natively-supported, which are the display and the buzzer.

tip: The heart to the BrainPad Pulse is SITCore SC113 chipset. And for BrainPad Edge is SITCore SC007.

## Getting Ready
The first step is to load the appropriate firmware onto the device. But first, we need to put the board in "loader mode". On Pulse, hold the **A** button down while resetting the board.  

Loading the firmware is done on the BrainPad loader page loader.brainpad.com
