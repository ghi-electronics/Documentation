## You're DUE for something NEW!

Leverage your coding skills to code things right from a PC, a phone, or even a Raspberry Pi! Read sensors and control motors using Python and other languages - no hardware experience is necessary.

A DUELink board bridges your host (computer/phone...etc.) to thousands of electronic sensors and modules. This allows for an easy hardware connections.

Say goodbye to intimidating loose wires and soldering - just plug-and-play!

## How does it work?

DUELink Spider leverages the computing power and connectivity of your host device. This includes Raspberry Pi, Phones, Tablets, and PC/MAC/Linux.

The DUELink Spider is not a programmable microcontroller, but a peripheral for the host device.  

This approach allows you to run full Python scripts, utilize JavaScript pages, tackle processor-intensive AI projects, and dive into big data analytics with ease - now with a physical element.
