## You're DUE for something NEW!

Physical computing was never easier, thanks to DUE. Developer can now read sensors and control motors right from their favorite programming languages.

DUE is a Dynamic, Universal, and Extensible platform that links devices to the physical world. These devices can be desktops, laptops, phones, or even a Raspberry PI. Developers have the option to use any modern operating system and use the programming language of their choice.

The DUE Link platform includes a scripting language called [DUE Script](~/software/due-script/due-script.md) it run internally on any [DUE-enabled hardware](~/hardware/intro.md). This allows the device to run standalone independent from any host. This very easy-to-learn scripting language is inspired by BASIC and Python, giving the user the simplicity and flexibility they need.

The on-line DUE Console lets developers start experimenting with DUE Script and the physical world in minutes...no installation is necessary!
