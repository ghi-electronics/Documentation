Tip We will refer to .NET Gadgeteer as Gadgeteer throughout the rest of the documentation. The core of .NET Gadgeteer is .NET Micro Framework (NETMF). Like Gadgeteer, NETMF is no longer evolved by Microsoft and left for the community. Learn more about NETMF Sadly, and after 5 years of building modules and mainboards, GHI Electronics had to announce the EOL for Gadgeteer; however, most of the Gadgeteer hardware can still be used with TinyCLR OS .

Using .NET Gadgeteer To use .NET Gadgeteer's legacy software, install: Visual Studio 20013 (community edition is also supported) Unzip and install netmfvs2013.vsix and MicroFramewrokSDK.msi from here Microsoft's Gadgeteer Core GHI Electronics' NETMF SDK . The latest is recommended. The Gadgeteer for Beginners guide is a good starting point. Tip You can only use Visual Studio 2013, not a newer edition, unless you are using your Gadgeteer hardware with TinyCLR OS . With TinyCLR OS Most of the .NET Gadgeteer devices are still usable today, and with the latest technologies, thanks to efforts by GHI Electronics and the community. It all started in this video! This means you can still use all your beloved .NET Gadgeteer gear with TinyCLR OS . The first step needed to use TinyCLR OS is to load the GHI Electronics Bootloader v2 onto your mainboard, then use that to load the TinyCLR OS firmware. Each mainboard product page includes the needed instructions. Once those are loaded, you can start blinking the debug LED, detailed in the next section. Blinking the LED Tip If you have never used TinyCLR OS before, start here This example will blink the debug LED. You only need to add a power module to your mainboard. using System.Threading; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; class Program { static void Main() { var led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(FEZSpider.GpioPin.DebugLed); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); while(true) { led.Write(GpioPinValue.High); Thread.Sleep(200); led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); Thread.Sleep(200); } } } Tip The complete pin mapping is made available through GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins . You should not need to use any schematics. Replace FEZSpider with your mainboard's name. Adding Gadgeteer Modules You are now ready to start adding modules ."

It is pulled high internally on the G120E and left floating on the G120. There are four different components of the device firmware: GHI Electronics Bootloader: initializes the system, updates TinyBooter when needed, and executes TinyBooter. TinyBooter: executes NETMF, updates NETMF when needed, and updates the system configuration. NETMF: loads, debugs, and executes the managed application. Managed application: the program developed by the customer. Which components get executed on startup can be control by manipulating the LDR0 and LDR1 pins. LDR0 and LDR1 are pulled high on startup. LDRO LDR1 Effect Ignored High Execute the managed application High Low Wait in TinyBooter Low Low Wait in GHI Electronics Bootloader Additionally, the communications interface between the host PC and the G120 is selected on startup through the MODE pin, which is pulled high on startup MODE G120 G120E High USB UART1 Low UART1 USB The above discussed functions of LDR0, LDR1, and MODE are only during startup. After startup, they return to the default GPIO state and are available to use as GPIO in the user application. .NET Micro Framework (NETMF) The NETMF software on G120 is mature and complete. For more information on NETMF you can go to the NETMF Introduction page. The NETMF Getting Started page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device. Loading the Firmware Activate the bootloader, hold the LDR0 signal low while resetting the board. Open FEZ Config tool and follow the instructions. You can also update the firmware manually. See GHI Electronics Bootloader page. Start Coding Now that you have installed the bootloader and firmware on the G120, you can setup your host computer and start programming. Go to the NETMF Getting Started page for instructions. Datasheet This documentation page replaced the legacy datasheet PDF but it is here for reference.

Voltages should be within at least 10% of the needed voltage. Decoupling capacitors of 0.1 μF are needed near every power pin. Additionally, a large capacitor, typically 47 μF, should be near the G120 if the power supply is more than few inches away. Crystals The G120 and G120E include the needed system crystal and its associated circuitry. The G120E additionally includes the RTC crystal and its associated circuitry. However, the G120 does not. It requires an external 32,768 Hz crystal and circuitry for the RTC to function. Please see the processor’s documentation for advanced information. Interrupt Pins Only pins on ports 0 and 2 support interrupts. Reset The G120E includes an internal pull-up resistor on the reset pin. The G120 does not, so an external 15 kΩ pull-up resistor is required for correct operation. SPI Channels SPI2 is shared internally with the flash memory on the G120. Use of a chip select with devices on this channel is required or the G120 will not function properly. The use of another SPI channel is recommended. Ethernet The built in Ethernet available on the G120E includes all needed Ethernet circuitry internally. However, an appropriate magnet and connector, like the J0011D or similar, are required. Oven Reflow The G120 is not sealed for moisture. Baking the module before reflow is recommended and required in a humid environment. The process of reflow can damage the G120 if the temperature is too high or exposure is too long. The lead-free reflow profiles used by GHI Electronics are shown below. The profiles are based on AIM SAC 305 solder (3% silver, 0.5% copper). The thermal mass of the assembled board and the sensitivity of the components on it affect the total dwell time. Differences in the two profiles are where they reach their respective peak temperatures as well as the time above liquids (TAL). The shorter profile applies to smaller assemblies, whereas the longer profile applies to larger assemblies such as back-planes or high-density boards. The process window is described by the shaded area. These profiles are only starting-points and general guidance. The particulars of an oven and the assembly will determine the final process. G120 Development Board The G120E Dev Board is an excellent starting point and reference design for anyone interested in evaluating and developing with the G120/G120E.

For more information on NETMF you can go to the NETMF Introduction page. The NETMF Getting Started page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device. Bootloader v1 is needed for G400 to work with NETMF. It is available in the NETMF SDK. Loading Bootloader Download the G400 bootloader file and load onto the dataflash using the Microchip (Atmel) SAM-BA tool and the following instructions. To set the chip in SAM-BA mode, hold down the dedicated button on your board (SYS A on UCM Dev and Breakout boards) while the system powers up (or during reset). If there is no such button, connect G400D pin SPI1_MISO to ground. Keep the button pressed (pin grounded) for three seconds after power up or reset, then release the pin. The device manager will show a COM port similar to \"Bossa Program Port\" or \"GPS Detect\". If it is not already installed, download and install the SAM-BA tool from Microchip. The latest version we have tested is 2.18 for Windows. (The tool may not show correctly. Try to make the window larger to see all hidden buttons!) Open the SAM-BA program then select the COM port for your device in the connection box and your board type below it (at91sam9x35-ek for G400), then click connect. Near the middle of the window, go to the DataFlash AT45DB/DCB tab. Under Scripts , select Enable Dataflash (SPI0 CS0) then click the Execute button. Under Scripts , select Erase All then click Execute . This will take some time to complete. It seems that if SAM-BA loses focus during the erase procedure it can seem to lock up. We recommend that once you click the Execute button you leave the computer alone until the erase procedure is completed. Under Scripts , select Send Boot File , click execute, then browse to and select the bootloader for the device. Once the transfer finishes, go to File > Quit and then reset the board. Make sure to properly quit the program or connection errors may result on subsequent uses. Now reset the board. Congratulations, your board is now running the loaded program! Loading the Firmware Activate the bootloader, hold the LDR0 signal (SYS B) low while resetting the board. Open the FEZ Config tool and follow the instructions. You can also update the firmware manually. Download the firmware and learn how to use the GHI Electronics Bootloader manually.

Developers can decide on the pin functionality to be used through the provided libraries. Any pin with no name, function, or note must be left unconnected. Footprint G400S Recommended Footprint Device Startup The G400 is held in reset when the reset pin is low. Releasing it will begin the system startup process. It is pulled high internally There are four different components of the device firmware: GHI Electronics Bootloader: initializes the system, updates TinyBooter when needed, and executes TinyBooter. TinyBooter: executes NETMF, updates NETMF when needed, and updates the system configuration. NETMF: loads, debugs, and executes the managed application. Managed application: the program developed by the customer. Which components get executed on startup can be control by manipulating the LDR0 and LDR1 pins. LDR0 and LDR1 are pulled high on startup. LDRO LDR1 Effect Ignored High Execute the managed application High Low Wait in TinyBooter Low Low Wait in GHI Electronics Bootloader Additionally, the communications interface between the host PC and the G400 is selected on startup through the MODE pin, which is pulled high on startup. The USB interface is selected when MODE is high and UART1 is selected when MODE is low. The above discussed functions of LDR0, LDR1, and MODE are only during startup. After startup, they return to the default GPIO state and are available to use as GPIO in the user application. .NET Micro Framework (NETMF) The NETMF software on G400 is mature and complete. For more information on NETMF you can go to the NETMF Introduction page. The NETMF Getting Started page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device. Bootloader v1 is needed for G400 to work with NETMF. It is available in the NETMF SDK. Loading Bootloader Download the G400 bootloader file and load onto the dataflash using the Microchip (Atmel) SAM-BA tool and the following instructions. To set the chip in SAM-BA mode, hold down the dedicated button on your board (SYS A on UCM Dev and Breakout boards) while the system powers up (or during reset). If there is no such button, connect G400S pin SPI1_MISO to ground. Keep the button pressed (pin grounded) for three seconds after power up or reset, then release the pin. The device manager will show a COM port similar to \"Bossa Program Port\" or \"GPS Detect\". If it is not already installed, download and install the SAM-BA tool from Microchip. The latest version we have tested is 2.18 for Windows. (The tool may not show correctly. Try to make the window larger to see all hidden buttons!) Open the SAM-BA program then select the COM port for your device in the connection box and your board type below it (at91sam9x35-ek for G400), then click connect. Near the middle of the window, go to the DataFlash AT45DB/DCB tab. Under Scripts , select Enable Dataflash (SPI0 CS0) then click the Execute button. Under Scripts , select Erase All then click Execute . This will take some time to complete. It seems that if SAM-BA loses focus during the erase procedure it can seem to lock up. We recommend that once you click the Execute button you leave the computer alone until the erase procedure is completed. Under Scripts , select Send Boot File , click execute, then browse to and select the bootloader for the device. Once the transfer finishes, go to File > Quit and then reset the board. Make sure to properly quit the program or connection errors may result on subsequent uses. Now reset the board. Congratulations, your board is now running the loaded program! Loading the Firmware Activate the bootloader, hold the LDR0 signal low while resetting the board. Open FEZ Config tool and follow the instructions. You can also update the firmware manually. See GHI Electronics Bootloader page. Start Coding Now that you have installed the bootloader and firmware, you can setup your host computer and start programming. Go to the NETMF Getting Started page for instructions. Datasheet This documentation page replaced the legacy datasheet PDF but it is here for reference. CAN Bit Timing Settings The following CAN bit timing parameters were calculated for a G400 driving the SN65HVD230 CAN driver chip. See the CAN Tutorial for more information.

Design Considerations Required Pins Exposing the following pins is required in every design to enable device programming, updates, and recovery: LDR0 LDR1 Reset Desired debug interface(s) MODE if required to select a debug interface SPI1 MISO to update TinyBooter in SDK 2015 R1 and earlier and to install the GHI Electronics Bootloader once for SDK 2016 R1 and later Power Supply A typical clean power source, suited for digital circuitry, is needed to power the G400. Voltages should be within at least 10% of the needed voltage. Decoupling capacitors of 0.1 μF are needed near every power pin. Additionally, a large capacitor, typically 47 μF, should be near the G400 if the power supply is more than few inches away. Additionally, the G400 requires additional voltages beyond the typical 3.3 V to function properly. See the pinout table for details. Crystals The G400 includes the needed system and RTC crystals and their associated circuitry. SPI Channels SPI1 is shared internally with the flash memory on the G400. Use of a chip select with devices on this channel is required or the G400 will not function properly. The use of another SPI channel is recommended. Ethernet The built in Ethernet available on the G400D includes all needed Ethernet circuitry internally. However, an appropriate magnet and connector, like the J0011D or similar, are required. Soldering the G400S The G400S is designed to be easily machine-placed or hand-soldered. Static sensitive precautions should be taken when handling the module. Oven Reflow The G400S is not sealed for moisture. Baking the module before reflow is recommended and required in a humid environment. The process of reflow can damage the G400 if the temperature is too high or exposure is too long. The lead-free reflow profiles used by GHI Electronics are shown below. The profiles are based on AIM SAC 305 solder (3% silver, 0.5% copper). The thermal mass of the assembled board and the sensitivity of the components on it affect the total dwell time. Differences in the two profiles are where they reach their respective peak temperatures as well as the time above liquids (TAL). The shorter profile applies to smaller assemblies, whereas the longer profile applies to larger assemblies such as back-planes or high-density boards. The process window is described by the shaded area. These profiles are only starting-points and general guidance. The particulars of an oven and the assembly will determine the final process.

Crystals The G80 requires an external 12 MHz crystal and associated circuitry to function. For the RTC to function, a 32,768 Hz crystal and circuitry are required. Please see the processor’s documentation for advanced information. Interrupt Pins Interrupts are only available on 16 pins at any given time. Of those 16 pins, the pin number must be unique. For example: PA1 and PB1 cannot both be used as interrupts at the same time, but PA1 and PB2 can. Reset The reset pin is not pulled in any direction. Designs must be sure to use an appropriate pull-up resistor.

We strive to keep customers products viable as long as possible with no or minimal changes to hardware.

The recommended replacement is SC20100S 100LQFP, with considerably more horsepower and available resources. G80 to SITCore The SITCore SC20100S is LQFP100 with near identical pinout and compatibility with the G80, however it is not a drop-in replacement and some small changes are necessary. The table below provides a pinout comparison. SC20100S to G80 Pinout Map G120 to SITCore Our SCM20260N is a drop in replacement for the G120 with the following differences that will rarely be an issue. The following pads/pins on the SCM20260N do not support hardware PWM: Pad 3/pin PK7, pad 23/pin PC10, pad 24/pin PC9, pad 25/pin PC12, pad 26/pin PC8, pad 28/pin PD2, pad 85/pin PI12, and pad 90/pin PI13. SCM20260N pad 80 (PK6/LCD B7) and pad 88 (PJ6/LCD R7) do not have UART TX and RX as found on G120 pads 80 and 88. As this is an LCD pin, this will rarely be an issue. Pad 15 on the SCM20260N (PI2/SPI2 MISO/TIM8 CH4 + PD3/USART2 CTS through a 330 ohm resistor) provides USART CTS connected through a 330 ohm resistor to maintain compatibility with Pad 15 on the G120 (P0.17/UART2 CTS/SPI1 MISO). The SCM20260N serial debug port (UART5) is exposed on pads 29 and 30 of the SoM, while on the G120 the serial debug (UART1) is on pads 5 and 6. This will only be a problem when using serial debugging/deployment -- USB debugging/deployment is not affected. SCM20260N to G120 Pinout Map G120E to SITCore Our SCM20260E is a drop in replacement for the G120E except for a few issues that will rarely present any problem. To enable serial deployment and debugging, the MOD pin on the SCM20260E is active low, while on the G120E the MODE pin is active high. A minor change will be needed to correct the MOD level and select the desired debugging interface. Serial mode deploying and debugging defaults to UART5 on the SCM20260E versus UART1 on the G120E. This is only a concern if serial mode deploying/debugging is needed. SCM20260E pad 57 (PD3/UART2 CTS) does not have PWM as on G120E pad 57 (P3.18/UART2 CTS/PWM2). SCM20260E pad T5 (PJ6/LCD R7) does not have UART RX as on G120E pad T5 (P2.9/LCD R4/UART5 RX). As this is an LCD pin, this will rarely be an issue. SCM20260E pad T16 (PJ6/LCD R7) does not have UART TX as on G120E pad T16 (P1.29/LCD B4/UART5 TX). As this is an LCD pin, this will rarely be an issue. SD Power pin is not available. Instead, there is regular GPIO pin. SCM20260E to G120E Pinout Map G400S to SITCore There is no drop-in replacement for the G400S. The recommended replacement is the SCM20260E, which has considerably more horsepower and available resources. G400D to SITCore Our SCM20260D is a drop in replacement for the G400D, with just a couple of differences that will rarely be an issue. SCM20260D pins 164 and 165 do not provide UART TX and RX as on the G400D. As these are LCD pins, this will rarely be an issue. There is no second USB host controller on the SITCore SCM20260D pins 182 and 184 as there is on the G400D. SCM20260D to G400D Pinout Map UC2550 and UC5500 to SITCore The recommended replacement, the SCM20260D, is close, but not completely compatible with the UC2550 and UC5550. Some PCB changes will be needed."

Please understand that these are just our observations -- we cannot guarantee the functionality or quality of any third party products. Here are images of OV9655 modules where one works and the other doesn't. The good modules have regulators labeled \"3DB8N\" and \"3Cb2b:\" . The bad modules have voltage regulators labeled \"2EB2S\" and \"3AB2I:\" Demo Program The SITCore SCM20260D Dev Board ships with a demonstration program that can be found on our TinyCLR-Samples GitHub repository. USB-C Functionality All SITCore single board computers use a USB-C connector for application deployment and debugging. While USB-C has many advantages, we've also noticed some flaws. Every USB-A to USB-C cable tested worked as expected. Testing USB-C to USB-C cables gave interesting and unexpected results. Most USB-C hubs also do not work when using USB-C to USB-C cables. If you are having problems deploying or debugging, try connecting the board directly to your computer with a USB-A to USB-C cable.

FEZ Pico Schematic FEZ Pico STEP file FEZ Pico Peripheral Pin User LED PA8 Button LDR = PC13 FEZ Feather The Adafruit Feather form factor boards are made to be stackable and have built-in support for 3.7V LiPo batteries with a charging circuit. The FEZ Feather provides both through hole pads and castellated edges making it both breadboard friendly and easy to build into products. Caution Lithium Polymoer(Li-Po) batteries are significantly more volatile than other rechargable batteries. Make sure you have an understand of how to properly charge and use them before connecting to the FEZ Feather. Never attempt to charge a damaged or swollen battery. Never leave battery charging unattended. Improper use could result in fire. Warning Be very careful to ensure the correct polarity of LiPo batteries before connecting them to the FEZ Feather. Reverse polarity will damage the charging circuit, and not all batteries are wired correctly. GHI Electronics is not responsible for, and will not warranty, damage caused by incorrectly connected batteries. Make sure the battery polarity is correct as shown below (red wire to plus, black to minus): Caution The 3.3v regulator may run hot, especially when WiFi is in use. You can add 3.3V regulator externally to eliminate this heat issue, and this is needed if adding any external components that draw more than 10mA.

Those need to be accounted for. Using Interrupts (IRQs) The microcontrollers we use in our SITCore line of products do not support concurrent interrupts with the same pin number, even if the pins are on different ports (the port is denoted by the second letter of the GPIO pin name -- PA1 is pin 1 on port A). Therefore, interrupts are available on only 16 pins at any given time. For example, pins PA1 and PB1 cannot be used as interrupt pins at the same time, but PA1 and PB2 can. PA1 and PA2 can also be used with interrupts simultaneously. Pinouts GPIO pins are rated is 20mA per pin, 140mA total on all pins, and 5 volt tolerant. SC13048Q Pinout SC20100S/B Pinout SC20260B Pinout Device Startup The SITCore is held in reset while the RESET pin is low. Releasing RESET will begin the system startup process. There are three different components of the device firmware: GHI Electronics Bootloader: initializes the system, updates TinyCLR when needed, and executes TinyCLR. TinyCLR: used to load, debug, and execute the managed application. Managed application: the program developed by you or your software developer. Which components get executed on startup is controlled by manipulating the LDR pin. It is pulled high on startup during normal program execution. When low, the device waits in the GHI Electronics Bootloader. Otherwise, the managed application is executed. The APP pin is used to stop the managed application from running. Additionally, the communications interface between the host PC and the SITCore is selected on startup through the MOD pin, which is pulled high on startup. The USB interface is selected when MOD is high and UART1 is selected when MOD is low. The above discussed functions of the LDR, APP, and MOD pins are only available during startup. After startup, the pins return to the default GPIO state and are available as a GPIO (or peripheral pin) in your application. Check out the Special Pins page for more information. TinyCLR OS TinyCLR OS provides a way to program the SITCore in C# from the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment. To get started you must first install the firmware on the SITCore (instructions below) and then go to the TinyCLR Getting Started page for instructions. Loading the Firmware Activate the bootloader, hold the LDR signal low while resetting the board. Open TinyCLR Config tool. Click the loader tab. Select the correct COM port. If you are not seeing it then the device is not in the loader mode. Click the Update to Latest button. You can also update the firmware manually. Download the firmware and learn how to use the GHI Electronics Bootloader manually Start Coding Now that you have installed the bootloader and firmware on the SITCore, you can setup your host computer and start programming. Go to the TinyCLR Getting Started page for instructions. Design Considerations Footprints This is the recommended footprint for the SC13048Q: This is the recommended footprint for the SC20100S: This is the recommended footprint for the SC20100B: This is the recommended footprint and PCB design rules for the SC20260B: Required Pins Exposing the following pins is required in every design to enable device programming, updates, and recovery: RESET LDR APP MOD (required to select a the debug interface) Desired debug interface(s) (see below) For information on these and other important pins, please refer to the Special Pins page. Debug Interface All SITCore products provide two debug and deployment interfaces: USB and serial. Whether USB or serial debugging is selected is determined by the state of the MOD pin during startup and reset. If the MOD pin is held high during startup, the USB debug interface will be selected. If the MOD pin is held low during startup, the serial debug interface will be selected. When in serial mode, all SITCore products use UART1 except SC20260B chipset/boards use UART5. Power Supply A clean power source, suitable for digital circuitry, is needed to power SITCore SoCs. Voltages should be regulated to within 10% or better of the specified voltage. Decoupling capacitors of 0.1 uF are needed near every power pin. Additionally, a large capacitor, typically 47 uF, should be placed near the SoC if the power supply is more than few inches away. Analog Considerations It is a good idea to provide a separate filtered supply line for the Vdda , and Vref+ pins. Additionally, on the 260 pin devices, you may want to provide a separate filtered ground connection for the Vssa and Vref- pins. While this is not needed for ADC operation, it does help to ensure more accurate ADC readings by reducing analog supply noise. Crystals There is a lot to consider when selecting a crystal -- especially the RTC crystal. Please consult AN2867 from STMicroelectronics. Main Crystal Most 8 MHz quartz crystals and ceramic resonators from various manufacturer will work with SITCore SoCs. The table below will tell you what to look for based on the crystal's maximum equivalent series resistance (ESR), shunt capacitance (C0), and load capacitance (CL). Keeping the total capacitance of C0 + CL well below the recommended maximum will provide more of a safety margin for stable and reliable oscillator operation. The SITCore SC13048 SoC main clock can also operate using an internal oscillators, with no need for any crystals, even when using USB. If an application requires better accuracy, like when running CAN for example, an external oscillator can be added. Max crystal ESR (ohms) Recommended max total of C0 and CL (pF) 40 49 50 44 60 40 70 37 80 35 100 31 200 22 300 18 RTC Crystal It can be difficult to select the right RTC crystals, that is due to the RTC oscillator running on an extremely low power. The table below should help. For reliable operation, the total capacitance of C0 (crystal shunt capacitance) and CL (crystal load capacitance) must be less than the recommended max total of C0 and CL. The SITCore SC13048 SoC built in RTC can also operate using an internal oscillator when a 32.768Khz crystals is not present, however adding an external crystal gives better RTC accuracy. Max crystal ESR (kilohms) Recommended max total of C0 and CL (pF) 30 9.9 40 8.5 50 7.6 60 7.0 70 6.5 80 6.0 90 5.7 100 5.4 When laying out your board, it is best to keep the crystal as close as possible to the SoC. The oscillator circuit should also be surrounded by a grounded guard ring or ground plane on the same layer to reduce noise. RTC Power The VBAT pin is optionally used to power up the RTC when the system main power is turned off. Also, SITCore chipsets and modules include a built in charging circuit internally, that can be enabled to charge an external supercap. See the RTC tutorial for further details. QuadSPI External Flash SITCore supports 16 MByte external QuadSPI flash chips. The options are in the table below. Manufacture Part Number Winbond Electronics W25Q128JVSIM Winbond Electronics W25Q128JVSIQ Reset SITCore processors have a permanent internal pull up resistor that is connected to the RESET (NRST) pin. No external pull up resistor is needed. Oven Reflow Profile SITCore SoCs are not sealed for moisture. Baking SoCs before reflow is recommended and required in a humid environment . The process of reflow can damage the SoC if the temperature is too high or exposure is too long. The lead-free reflow profiles used by GHI Electronics are shown below. The profiles are based on AIM SAC 305 solder (3% silver, 0.5% copper). The thermal mass of the assembled board and the sensitivity of the components on it affect the total dwell time. Differences in the two profiles are where they reach their respective peak temperatures as well as the time above liquids (TAL). The shorter profile applies to smaller assemblies, whereas the longer profile applies to larger assemblies such as back-planes or high-density boards. The process window is described by the shaded area. These profiles are only starting-points and general guidance. The particulars of the oven and the assembly will determine the final process.

Therefore, interrupts are available on only 16 pins at any given time. For example, pins PA1 and PB1 cannot be used as interrupt pins at the same time, but PA1 and PB2 can. PA1 and PA2 can also be used with interrupts simultaneously.

Design Considerations Footprints We recommend no traces or vias under the module. Dimensions are in inches. SCM20100E Recommended Footprint SCM20260N Recommended Footprint SCM20260E Recommended Footprint SCM20260D SO-DIMM Socket The SCM20260D uses the same 200 pin SO-DIMM socket that was originally made for DDR2 memory modules. You can make a custom SO-DIMM SITCore circuit board by adding the appropriate SO-DIMM socket to your circuit board. Tip Make sure to expose the required pins in your design. Specific pins are needed for device programming, updates, recovery, and WiFi firmware updates. See the Special Pins page and the device specifications for details. SO-DIMM stands for Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module. There are two different 200 pin SO-DIMM sockets, those made for DDR memory and those made for DDR2 memory. They are identical except for the orientation notch which is in a slightly different position. These sockets are not interchangeable. There is also a 204 pin SO-DIMM socket for DDR3 memory with the notch positioned closer to the center of the module. Note Our UCMs are only compatible with DDR2 type 200 pin SO-DIMM sockets. Here is a link to the manufacturer's web page for the connector we use on our boards: EMBOSS ASSY DDR2 SODIMM SOCKET 200P 5.2H Required Pins Exposing the following pins is required in every design to enable device programming, updates, and recovery: RESET LDR APP MOD (if required to select a debug interface) Desired debug interface(s) For information on these and other important pins, please refer to the Special Pins page. Power Supply A clean power source, suitable for digital circuitry, is needed to power SITCore SoMs. Voltages should be regulated to within 10% or better of the specified voltage. Additionally, a large capacitor, typically 47 uF, should be placed near the SoM if the power supply is more than few inches away. Analog Considerations Where these pins are provided, using a separate filtered supply for Analog 3.3V and Analog VREF+ may help to improve ADC accuracy by reducing analog supply noise. For the same reason, you may want to provide a separate and clean analog ground for the Analog GND and Analog VREF- , if these pads are provided on the SoM you are using. Oven Reflow Profile SITCore SoMs are not sealed for moisture. Baking modules before reflow is recommended and required in a humid environment. The process of reflow can damage the SoM if the temperature is too high or exposure is too long. The lead-free reflow profiles used by GHI Electronics are shown below. The profiles are based on AIM SAC 305 solder (3% silver, 0.5% copper). The thermal mass of the assembled board and the sensitivity of the components on it affect the total dwell time. Differences in the two profiles are where they reach their respective peak temperatures as well as the time above liquids (TAL). The shorter profile applies to smaller assemblies, whereas the longer profile applies to larger assemblies such as back-planes or high-density boards. The process window is described by the shaded area. These profiles are only starting-points and general guidance. The particulars of the oven and the assembly will determine the final process. SITCore Dev Boards We offer SITCore development boards to get you started as quickly and easily as possible.

    "keywords": "UCM Development Options These options are provided to speed the development of your product and make it possible to start programming your application within minutes without designing or building new hardware. You may also use these products as quick drop-in options into your design as well. Code Samples For some examples of using the development options in TinyCLR, take a look at the TinyCLR Samples repo . You may also find the TinyCLR tutorials useful. UCM Dev Board Ordering Part Number: UCD-DEV-E Schematic The UCM Dev Board is the fastest and easiest way to start using our Universal Compute Modules. This board provides a socket for the UCM, standard connectors for input/output, and three 40 pin socket headers for connecting peripherals and a display. Peripheral connectors include external power, Ethernet, CAN, USB host and client, RTC backup battery, DCMI interface and an SD card slot. It also has a buzzer, LEDs, a reset button, and user programmable boot buttons. To start development using the UCM Dev Board, just plug a UCM into the socket on the board and connect the board's USB Client port to a host computer using a micro USB. Go to the documentation page for the particular UCM you are using for instructions. For power, the board can be powered through either USB connectors or the barrel jack. Always use the barrel jack for power when using displays, especially the larger ones. USB does not provide sufficient power needed for displays. Tip The barrel jack is pin positive, sleeve negative, 2.1mm. It is capable of anywhere 7V to 30V. 1A of power should be enough for most needs. UCM Breakout Board Ordering Part Number: UCD-BKT-C Schematic The UCM Breakout Board provides a socket for UCMs, and both through hole and surface mount edge connections for soldering the Breakout Board to your own circuit board. You can solder pin headers to the Breakout Board and use traditional breadboarding techniques to build your prototype as well. This board makes it easier to use UCMs in prototypes or products without the need to solder the fine pitch 200 pin SO-DIMM socket. For added convenience, it also includes USB Client connector, a reset button, four user programmable boot buttons, and a micro SD card slot. Please note that this is a Breakout Board and it does not have any power supplies. You will need to add 3.3V or 5V as needed to power up your modules. However, the power from USB is available on one of the pins (5V USB) so it is possible to wire a 3.3V regulator. Tip There are 2 LEDs by the USB connector, for 3.3V and 5V. They are useful to check that you have supplied the necessary power. A simple board can be designed and hand soldered to host the Breakout Board. You can turn an idea into a product prototype in days! This example board example (in green) is made to be the exact same size as the 4.3\" universal display board. It can be designed with the display connector conveniently located in the right place. To start using the breakout board, plug one of the UCMs into the socket on the board and wire in 3.3V (you may also need 5V) and plug in USB into your PC. Go to the documentation page for the particular UCM you are using for instructions. Universal Displays Available displays work directly with the options above, just make sure you are using a SoM supporting the needed peripherals. The Universal Displays can be connected directly or wired though a 40-pin IDE extension ribbon cable, similar to the old-style IDE hard drive cable extender, with a Male connector on one end and a Female connector on the other. To connect a display with the Dev Board, simply plug it on top. The display can be larger than the board but it will still use the same connector (HDR C). When using the Breakout Board you need to add a female header. Make sure the header is placed on the back of the Breakout Board. Note how the Breakout Board, and potentially your host board, hide behind the display. This is a good advantage when mounting the display inside a product. Adding a ribbon cable allows for further flexibility on where and how far the display is mounted. The length of the cable is determined by clock frequency used with the display. If the image on the display is not stable, lower the clock or shorten the cable. In our testing, our display have worked perfectly with 10\" cable. UCD-D43-A Ordering Part Number: UCD-D43-A Display Module: ER-TFT043-3 Touch Panel: ER-TPC043-2 Schematic This display module has a 4.3\" 480x272 TFT display with capacitive touch screen. The display needs a UCM with TFT display support and needs I2C for the capacitive touch. The backlight is controllable through GPIO A. The capacitive touch controller is connected I2C A with the interrupt pin on GPIO B. The TinyCLR Samples repo has usage examples. Learn more about the graphics support.

The display needs a UCM with TFT display support and needs I2C for the capacitive touch. The backlight is controllable through GPIO A. The capacitive touch controller is connected I2C A with the interrupt pin on GPIO B. The display is exactly the same size as the Dev Board. They can be nicely mounted back to back with stand offs. A ribbon cable will be needed for the display signals. The TinyCLR Samples repo has usage examples. Learn more about the graphics support.

It is possible to design a custom display to utilize the UCM mainboards, or design a mainboard to utilize the available displays. Additionally, the designs of the development options can be used as a reference to start a UCMbased design. GHI Electronics' engineering/manufacturing is available for such designs.

    "title": "The UCM Standard",
    "keywords": "The UCM Standard The UCM Standard defines a consistent hardware and software interface for the most widely used microcontroller peripherals. Universal Compute Modules are based on the 200 pin SO-DIMM form factor. They adhere to a standard pinout across models making it easy to change modules to adapt to the needs of your product. When designing a product, consider following thee UCM standard pinout. This will make your design compatible with any of the UCM modules. Software also becomes more portable with the UCM standard. For example, our TinyCLR OS provides a library to automatically map the UCM standard names to the underlying system so that your program can use the UCM standard names only, making changing to a different module very easy. The SO-DIMM Socket All of our UCMs use the same 200 pin SO-DIMM socket that was originally made for DDR2 memory modules. The fastest way to get started with UCMs is by using the optional boards and displays described on the UCM Development Options page. You can also incorporate any of our UCMs into your own custom design by adding the appropriate SO-DIMM socket to your circuit board. Tip Make sure to expose the required pins in your design. Specific pins are needed for device programming, updates, recovery, and WiFi firmware updates. See device specifications for details. SO-DIMM stands for Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module.

Here is a link to the manufacturer's web page for the connector we use on our boards: EMBOSS ASSY DDR2 SODIMM SOCKET 200P 5.2H Peripherals Peripheral Up to Max UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) 4 UART HS (Handshaking) 2 I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) 2 SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) 2 CAN (Controller Area Network) 2 SDIO (SD Card) 1 ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) 8 PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) 8 GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) 12 IRQ (Interrupt Request Capable GPIO) 4 USB Client 1 USB Host 1 LCD (TFT Controller - 16bpp or 24bpp) 1 Ethernet PHY (Ethernet Physical Layer) 1 DCMI (Digital Camera Interface) 1 VBAT (Battery Backup for RTC) 1 JTAG (Debug Serial Port) 1 * Available peripherals vary by model Note that the system defines 12 GPIOs that are free from any other functions but most other peripheral pins also support GPIO, giving the user several more GPIO pin options -- keep in mind the standard does not guarantee this though. Tip The TinyCLR tutorials are a good resource on using these peripherals. UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) UART is used to implement moderate speed full duplex asynchronous serial communication. It is usually used for peer to peer communication between only two devices. It can transfer data using only one wire for each direction if both devices share a common ground. UART HS (Handshaking) UART with handshaking is a configuration which allows the host and client to negotiate data transfer via Ready to Send (RTS) and Clear to Send (CTS) signals (two additional wires) to prevent missed data. I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) I2C is a multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, half duplex serial communication bus typically used for attaching peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. It uses two wires and has a slower maximum speed than SPI. SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) SPI is a synchronous serial communication interface used for short distance communication. It uses a master-slave protocol. When using TinyCLR, the processor running TinyCLR is always configured as the master. SPI needs at least three wires and usually needs an additional line (chip select) for each slave. It can communicate much faster than either UART or I2C. CAN (Controller Area Network) A robust bus standard that originated in the automotive field and works very well in high noise environments. It allows microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer. It is a message-based multi-master protocol and generally uses only two wires. Speed is up to one megabit per second but limited by bus length. SDIO (SD Card) SDIO (Secure Digital Input Output) is an interface used for reading from and writing to SD cards. ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) ADCs are used to measure an analog voltage level by converting it to a digital value. PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) PWM is a method of generating a square wave signal of uniform frequency with variable duty cycle. PWM is often used to generate analog voltages, but has many other uses such as generating digital pulses for driving servo motors or driving infrared LEDs for communication. GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) GPIOs are the digital I/O pins that allow the user to interface with basic devices such as buttons (input) or LEDs (output). GPIOs are very versatile and can also be used to perform more advanced communication and control duties. IRQ (Interrupt Request Capable GPIO) IRQ capable GPIO pins can be programmed to interrupt a program when the input to the pin changes. For example, an IRQ could be used by a WiFi module to tell the processor that the WiFi module is receiving data. The processor would then stop what it is doing to get the data from the WiFi module. USB Client Used to communicate with a USB host. Often used to program and debug embedded devices. USB Host Used to communicate with one or more USB clients. Typically used to communicate with various devices such as a mouse, keyboard, camera, etc. LCD (TFT Controller - 16bpp or 24bpp) An interface providing communication with a TFT LCD (thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display). The number of data lines connected determines the number of bits per pixel (bpp), which determines the number of colors that can be displayed. Ethernet PHY Ethernet PHY is the Ethernet physical (hardware) layer. It provides the Tx and Rx signals for the Ethernet connector. DCMI (Digital Camera Interface) A standard interface for compatible digital cameras. VBAT (Battery Backup for RTC) VBAT is used to provide battery voltage to a microcontroller's real time clock. It allows the microcontroller to keep the correct time when the main power to the controller is disconnected (the device is turned off). JTAG JTAG is a serial interface which allows communication between the processor and a host computer. It is built into the microcontroller and provides a means of software debugging including the ability to stop program execution, single step through program instructions, and read and write to memory and processor registers.

    "title": "Debugging",
    "keywords": "Debugging While MicroPython does not have the full debugging experience found with Visual Studio and TinyCLR OS, the built in REPL provides some interesting uses. Thanks to the MicroPython's built-in compiler and runtime engine. There are 2 very important hot-keys that are always handy, ctrl+C to exit from a looping program and going back to REPL and ctrl+D to soft reset the OS. Assuming there is a robot with I2C-controlled headlight and we need to write a driver for those headlights. The first step would be to create a file in the virtual drive that show up when connecting the MicroPython running board. We can now open the file and add the drivers. from machine import Pin, SoftI2C i2c4 = SoftI2C(scl=Pin(\"PB11\"), sda=Pin(\"PB10\")) buf4= bytearray(4) buf4[0]=0x01 def set(r,g,b): buf4[1]=r buf4[2]=g buf4[3]=b i2c4.writeto(0x01, buf4) set(100,100,0) When saving the file, we need to make sure to observe the activity LED to make sure the file is done saving, which takes few seconds. The REPL interface can now be used to import the driver we have just created, import headlights . Looking at the driver example, it creates a set function and then it calls it with colors 100,100,0 for RGB (Yellow). Tip import only works once on any module. Calling it a second time has no effect. We now can set the headlight colors, purple for example headlights.set(100,0,100) . Another option now is to include a flashing lights loop on power up, using main.py file. We will modify main.py contents: import headlights import time while True: headlights.set(100,0,0) time.sleep(0.2) headlights.set(0,0,100) time.sleep(0.2) Do not reset the board manually, instead use ctrl+D to soft reset. The LEDs will flash red and blue, like a police car! To exit the loop and reuse REPL, use ctrl+C. And then turn the headlights off headlights.set(0,0,0) . The system does not need import headlights as this was done earlier when main.py was loaded."

It works for full Python development but it is as useful for MicroPython. We first need to visit https://www.thonny.org/ and download the version compatible with the OS being used. In our example here, we are using Windows. The editor is now ready to edit and run full Python programs. To use Thonny with SITCore, we first need to plug in the SITCore device, such as FEZ Flea, and load it with MicroPython firmware as detailed in Getting Started . Then from the top menu Run->Select Interpreter... We need the MicroPython (generic) option and on the 'Port' drop down we need to select the REPL COM port.

This LED can be used by the user as well. We can now click the run icon or hit F5. This will send the script to the device and the LED will come on.

The Terminal Software Tera Term is the recommended terminal software but any other software should work. Tera Term is free and widely used. Download Tera Term from the downloads page or directly or search the web for downloads. Unzip the downloaded file and run ttermpro.exe . The software will look like the image below. Go ahead and click cancel on this page. The next step is to put the device in Loader mode. This is accomplished by setting LDR pin low during reset or power up. On devices that have LDR button, just hold the LDR button down and continue to hold it down while reseting the board and then release the LDR button. This step will bring the device into loader mode, which will load a new virtual serial port. On windows, the Device Manager will look something like the image below. Go back to Tera Term and, from the top menu, select File->New connection... . A new window will pop-up with serial ports updated with the COM port we have introduced in previous step. Select that new port and click OK. Hit the enter key and the device should respond with Invalid Command. Try to hit v followed by enter and the device will respond with the boot loader versions number. The device is now ready for the MicroPython firmware. The MicroPyhon Firmware Download the firmware from the Downloads page. Tip MicroPython is not available on all products. Back to Tera Term, press U followed by enter. The device will respond with Are you sure (Y/N)? Now press 'Y' followed by enter.' The device will now will be sending CCCCCCC..... indicating that it is ready for the MicroPython file. From top menu, File->Transfer->XMODEM->Send... . This is an important, commonly missed step, you MUST select the 1K checkbox! Select the downloaded MicroPython file (glb file type) from earlier step. Progress window will show the update status. When upload has completed, reset the board. If the firmware was loaded successfully, the PC will see a virtual memory driver, just like a USB memory drive. The drive will contain multiple files, one of them is main.py , which is what MicroPyhton automatically runs on power up. The device will also bring up a vistual COM port, just like the one used in loader mode but this COM is for the REPL interface. Activity LED PA8 pin is a special pin that is used by the system to indicate status. For example, the pin goes high when saving to the internal storage. The Python script can safely use PA8 but anytime the system needs to indicate something it will override the pin and then release it back to the script. REPL Read Evaluate Print Loop is a very quick way to command and control a MicroPython-running device. First find out the correct COM port and then start a new Tera Term connection to that port, just like we did with the boot loader. Once connected, the device will respond with something like: MicroPython v1.15-21-g4dc8024-dirty on 2021-04-30; GHI Electronics SITCore v0.1.0 with SC13048 >>> The device can now accept Python code! Try print(x) and the device will respond with an error about x . Now try x=10 and then print(x) . >>> x=10 >>> print(x) 10 >>> This is example code to turn on activate an LED on pin PA8 from machine import Pin led=Pin(\"PA8\",Pin.OUT_PP) led.high() It is also possible to add a loop through REPL. Once a loop statement is entered (ending with : ) the REPL will automatically indent the following line. To end the indentation and execute the block, press backspace or del, then enter. >>> for i in range(10): ... print(i) ... 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 >>> Tip For a quick help on a any module, use the help function, like use help(machine) . main.py This special file gets executed in power up. Open the file, from the device's virtual driver, and modify its content to a blink LED. Change the pin number to the LED on the device being used. from machine import Pin import time led=Pin(\"PA8\",Pin.OUT_PP) while True led.high(); time.sleep(0.5) led.low(); time.sleep(0.5) Save main.py and wait for the activity LED/pin to go low, then reset the board. The led should be blinking. Use ctrl+C on the terminal to stop the program and go back to REPL. Next Steps Now that the device is running MicroPython, we can start learning about debugging tricks. And then the tutorials is a good next step."

While TinyCLR OS with .NET C# and full debugging is the recommended path for building secure and modern devices there are instances where using MicroPython can be useful. The MicroPython project is found at http://www.micropython.org/ . GHI Electronics makes a ready-to-use MicroPython build for some of its products. Some areas where MicroPython shines: No complex software tools to setup. MicroPython is all-self-contained. Any serial terminal is enough to command/control/update the device. REPL allows for writing pure code on the device directly, where the device itself would compile and interpret. Python is a powerful scripting language that is relatively-easy to learn. Develop on any operating system as long as there is a terminal software! Reasons to use TinyCLR OS over MicroPython: True secure hardware with many security services. Solid and complete networking support. Full fledged debugging experience. Works with world-class Microsoft Visual Studio. NuGet cloud hosted libraries. C# is C's big sister, which is the global language for coding, especially on small devices. The GHI Electronics fork of MicroPython is found here .

The Pin class is uses to access GPIOs, located in the machine library. from machine import Pin Digital Outputs A digital output pin can be set to either high or low. High means that there is approx. 3.3V on the output pin. When the pin is set to low, it's voltage will be very close to zero. led=Pin(\"PA8\",Pin.OUT_PP) led.high() Digital Inputs Digital inputs sense the state of a pin based on its voltage. Minimum voltage on most pins is 0 volts; a negative voltage may damage the pin or the processor. Most processors run on 3.3V, the highest voltage a pin should see is 3.3V. However, some processors that are powered by 3.3V are 5V tolerant -- they can withstand up to 5V on their inputs. SITCore is 5V tolerant. Warning 5V tolerant doesn't mean the processor can be powered by 5V, only that the input pins can tolerate 5V. Unconnected input pins are called \"floating.\" A resistor can be added to pull the pin high or low. Modern processors include internal pull-up and pull-down resistors that are controlled by software. The code sample below uses an internal pull-up resistor to set the button high. When the button is pressed the GpioPinValue goes low. button = Pin(\"PB7\", Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP) button.value() Digital Input Interrupts Instead of polling a pin to determine it state, a function can be called when a pin is changed. def ButtonHandler(p) print(\"Pressed\", p) button = Pin(\"PB7\", Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP) button.irq(trigger=Pin.IRQ_FALLING, handler=ButtonHandler) Whenever the button is pressed (Falling Edge), the print will show \"Button\" flowed by the pin that caused the event. In this case it will show: Button Pin(Pin.cpu.B7, mode=Pin.IN, pull=Pin.PULL_UP) For further clarification, try print(button) and observe the output Pin(Pin.cpu.B7, mode=Pin.IN, pull=Pin.PULL_UP) ."

It is the first program to run and unless the device specific LDR pins are set (see device documentation for details), it will execute the firmware on the device (if present). The bootloader communicates over a USB virtual serial port and a regular serial port. The interface used is controlled by a MODE pin. See your device specifications for details on interface configuration and selection and which version of the bootloader it runs. Tip If you are running Windows 7 or Windows 8, you must install drivers for the bootloader to appear in Windows. See \"USB Drivers\" in the downloads section below. Bootloader v1 The original loader runs on Embedded Master, EMX, G120, G120E, G400D, G400S and USBizi. All results are terminated with LF (\\n). Commands are executed as soon as they entered without waiting for a new-line. \"BL\" or \"Done.\" will be sent after each command. On startup, a banner is sent that is terminated by \"BL\". Once the banner is received, you are free to enter any of the case-sensitive single-character commands described below. V: returns the current version. E: erases all user sectors of the device (* is sent while erasing). R: runs the firmware if present. B: increases the baud rate in serial mode to 921,600. X: upload a file to the device using 1K XMODEM. Only send *.ghi files meant for your device. The firmware is automatically run after a successful upload. Tip The USB interface on Version 1.0 doesn't work on Windows 7 and newer operating systems. Use the serial interface instead. Bootloader v2 This loader runs on G30, G80, UC25, UC55 and FEZ T18. All commands and results are terminated with CR and LF (\\r\\n). \"OK.\" will be sent after each successful command. On startup, a banner is sent that is terminated by \"OK.\". Once the banner is received, you are free to enter any of the case-insensitive single-character commands described below. Most commands require confirmation. Send Y or y followed by a new-line to proceed or anything else to cancel. V: returns the current version. N: returns the current device type. E: erases all user sectors of the device. R: runs the firmware if present. B: increases the baud rate in serial mode to 921,600. X: upload a ghi file to the device using 1K XMODEM. Only send *.ghi files meant for your device. U: upload a glb file to the device using 1K XMODEM. Only send *.glb files meant for your device. Manually Loading the Firmware TinyCLR Config tool should be used to update the firmware. As a backup, use these instructions: Put your board in bootloader mode. Each product has a specific way to enter the boot loader. Open any terminal software, for example Tera Term . Select serial and pick the COM port associated with your board. (If unsure, check Device Manager) Press V and then enter. You will see back the boot loader version number (v2.x.x) Press U or X and then enter. Use X for firmware file type GHI and U for firmware file type GLB. Press Y to confirm then enter. You will now see CCCC ... Go to File -> Transfer -> XMODEM -> Send . IMPORTANT: Make sure you check the 1K option. Select the firmware file. When the transfer is complete, reset your board. GLB File Format The glb files that are loaded onto devices have some additional metadata that help the bootloader function in addition to the raw data itself. The first 1,024 bytes of a glb file is the upload header. Starting from offset 0 are the below fields. The rest of the header is currently reserved. 32 bit signature number that is unique for each device. 32 bit unsigned address in flash that this image should be copied to. 32 bit unsigned length of the image to flash rounded to the nearest 1,024 bytes. 16 bit CRC-CCITT of the image. After the upload header is the actual image to flash. If its length is not divisible by 1,024 bytes, it is padded until it is. For images that are meant to be bootable, the address in the upload header should be set to the entry point defined for the specific device. Bootable images have an additional 1,024 byte header at the beginning of the image that is used to verify the image before booting it. The boot image is also padded to the nearest 1,024 bytes. Starting from offset 0 are the below fields. The rest of the header is currently reserved. 32 bit signature number that is unique for each device. 32 bit unsigned address in flash that is the entry point the bootloader will invoke. 32 bit unsigned length of the boot image rounded to the nearest 1,024 bytes. 16 bit CRC-CCITT of the boot image bounded by the specified address and length. Upgrading GHI Electronics Bootloader v1 to v2 Warning No longer supported! Some of our devices ship with v1 loader but require v2 loader to work with TinyCLR OS, such as G120. Download the bootloader file from the list below. Put your device in v1 mode (instructions are found on each product's documentation page). The PC will now detect a virtual serial (COM) device. If you need drivers, they are in the NETMF SDK. Open any terminal software, we recommend Tera Term . Select serial and pick the COM port associated with your board. Enter E and you will see back \"Erase all memory! Are you sure?\" now enter Y . (The bootloader is case sensitive) Enter X and you will see CCCC ... showing on the terminal. Now go to File -> Transfer -> XMODEM -> Send . IMPORTANT: Make sure you check the 1K option. Select the bootloader file you have downloaded above. You will see File Transfer Finished Successfully . Change the configuration switches back to the off position and reset the board. You are now running GHI Electronics bootloader v2! Bootloader Downloads Most products already ship with bootloader already installed. But in case the loader needs to be reloaded, the individual product pages include instructions on how to load the bootloader.

Get Started with .NET Micro Framework for Beginners To help you get started we have a free e-book in .pdf format: .NET Micro Framework for Beginners The Emulator The NETMF SDK includes an emulator for running NETMF applications on the PC. For the first part of this project, the emulator will be used to run a very simple application; afterwards the same program is run on NETMF hardware. Create a New Project Open Visual Studio, select File > New Project . There should be a Micro Framework option in the left menu. Click on it and then select Console Application in the center panel. Note The pictures used in this tutorial may vary slightly with different versions of the development platform. Click the OK button to create a new project. The project has only one C# file, called Program.cs . C# source files are listed in the Solution Explorer window. If the Solution Explorer is not open, use the View > Solution Explorer menu to open it. Double click on Program.cs to open the file in the editor. using System; using Microsoft.SPOT; namespace MFConsoleApplication1 { public class Program { public static void Main() { Debug.Print( Resources.GetString(Resources.StringResources.String1)); } } } For simplicity change the code to match the listing below: Tip All example code should be copied directly from this page and pasted into the Visual Studio program editor. using Microsoft.SPOT; public class Program { public static void Main() { Debug.Print(\"Amazing!\"); } } Selecting Transport When compiling a NETMF Console Project, there are options in Video Studio that control where the program is loaded and run. Select the menu item for the project's properties: In the Properties window, on the left side tabs, select .NET Micro Framework and make sure that Transport: is set to Emulator. Console applications have their Debug.Print statements appear in Visual Studio's Output Window. The application in this example uses print statements. If the Output window is not visible, open it by selecting Output in the View menu. Executing Press F5 and Visual Studio will compile the program, load it into the emulator and run it. The emulator displays a hypothetical NETMF device, complete with buttons and a screen. Do not close it. After a few seconds, the program will stop and the Output window will have \"Amazing!\" printed (surrounded by other application information). Introduction to Debugging The following sections are a quick introduction to the power and ease of debugging NETMF applications. Start running the program by pressing F11 (instead of F5 ), this will \"step\" into the application instead of just running it. After deployment, the program starts to run and stops at the very first line of the code. This is indicated by the yellow arrow. Press F11 to step to the \"Debug.Print\" statement. Finally, after pressing F11 one more time, \"Amazing!\" is printed in the Output window. Press F5 to let the program run to completion. Breakpoints Setting breakpoints is simple! -- Click in the bar to the left of the line that prints \"Amazing!\" A red dot appears to mark the breakpoint location. Press F5 to run the software. When the application reaches the breakpoint the debugger will pause: F11 can be used to single step execution line by line. F5 can be used to let the program run. Running on Hardware Deploying and running NETMF applications on hardware is very simple. Just connect the hardware, change an option in Visual Studio, and all loading, running, debugging, etc. are done on the device. The complete procedure is described below. Warning When working with hardware, take care not to expose the hardware to static electricity as it can damage the device. Connect and Power-up Connect the NETMF hardware to the PC using a USB cable. This is done one of two ways. If the processor has an integral USB port and is colored red, plug a USB cable from the computer directly to the board. Processors without an integral USB port will use a Gadgeteer socket to connect the power/USB module to the board. For these boards connect the power module to a \"D\" labeled socket on the board, then connect the power/USB module to the computer. (These circuit boards are black). The first time a processor is connected to the computer, Windows will need to load a driver. Wait until the driver is fully loaded before proceeding. Updating Device Software Before using a NETMF device, the embedded software must match the version of the SDK being used. Instructions for updating the embedded software are found on the Firmware Update page. If necessary, update your firmware, and then return here to continue the tutorial. Skipping the above step is the most common problem faced by beginners . Tip Many USB hubs are poorly implemented in PCs. If Windows failed to recognize the NETMF device or had any connection problems, make sure the device is connected directly to the PC, not through a USB hub. If problems persist, try using a power transformer or powered USB hub to guarantee the device is getting sufficient power. Deploying to Hardware Once the board is connected, Visual Studio has a control to switch back and forth between the emulator and connected hardware. From the project properties, select USB for transport.. Make sure the setup looks similar to the image below: Pressing F5 sends the simple application to the hardware and runs it. Debugging works exactly the same as described above. Next Steps We are currently updating the NETMF documentation found in our NETMF Tutorials ."

    "keywords": "Analog Outputs An analog output sets the voltage on its pin anywhere between 0 and the supplied voltage (maximum voltage) which is typically 3.3 volts. The output voltage is only a signal, not meant to drive any loads. An op-amp or similar circuit can be added to drive loads, such as a speaker. The analog out on a micro has \"precision:\" the precision of a particular processor is in its manual or datasheet; consequentially, actual output values on the pin are an approximation. For example, a micro with an 8-bit (256 steps) analog out has a step precision of 3.3V/256. In NETMF, the voltage to be output is specified as a percentage called the \"level.\" So, on a processor with a maximum output of 3.3V, a level of 0.5 (50%) would output around 1.65V. NETMF has two properties for the AnalogOutput class: Scale and Offset. The final voltage on the output pin will be: Final voltage = maximum output * ( (level*Scale) + Offset)) Final voltages are clipped to fit in the range 0V to maximum pin voltage. Example The processor in this example has a maximum output of 3.3 volts. The 50% voltage (level == 0.5) by default would generate 1.65V. Because of Scale, the actual percent will be 10 (0.5 * 0.2), which results in an output voltage of about 0.33V (3.3V * 0.1). The following code requires the Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware assembly. using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { public static void Main() { //Setup Analog on the first analog output channel AnalogOutput output = new AnalogOutput( Cpu.AnalogOutputChannel.ANALOG_OUTPUT_0); output.Scale = 0.2; output.Write(0.5); //output approx. 0.33V } }"

    "title": "CAN",
    "keywords": "CAN Controller Area Network (CAN) is a very common interface in industrial and automotive control. CAN is very robust and works very well in noisy environments at high speeds. All error checking and recovery methods are done automatically on the hardware. TD (Transmit Data) and RD (Receive Date) are the only two pins needed. There is no master/slave relationship in CAN. All nodes are equal and can both transmit and receive. CAN includes a protocal which easily allows for a node to claim a slice of time for its use so that collisions do not occur. You must have at least two nodes on the bus, however, or CAN will not work. There are many kinds of physical layers, but the most commonly used is a high-speed-dual wire that uses a twisted pair for noise immunity. This transceiver can run at up to 1 Mbit/s and can transfer data on very long wires if a low bit rate is used. Data can be transferred between nodes on the bus where any node can transfer at any time and all other nodes are required to successfully receive the data. All nodes must have a predefined bit timing criteria. This is much more complicated than calculating a simple baud rate for UART. For this reason, many CAN bit rate calculators are available which you can find using a simple internet search. We provide a few precalculated speeds that you can use but you can create more precise custom timings if you wish. There is an informative CAN guide in our downloads. The above image shows two CAN nodes connected over a bus with the 120 ohm resistors required on these transceivers. Tip Make sure to check the datasheet from the tranceiver. Most CAN controllers will divide the frequency by 2 before actually using it. Getting Started The code below sends a message over the CAN bus and prints out every message it receives to the debug window. It requires the GHI.Hardware assembly be added to the resources in your Visual Studio project. using GHI.IO; using Microsoft.SPOT; using System.Threading; public class Program { public static void Main() { var can = new ControllerAreaNetwork(ControllerAreaNetwork.Channel.One, ControllerAreaNetwork.Speed.Kbps1000); can.ErrorReceived += can_ErrorReceived; can.MessageAvailable += can_MessageAvailable; can.Enabled = true; can.SendMessage(new ControllerAreaNetwork.Message() { Data = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08 }, ArbitrationId = 0x12345678, Length = 8, IsRemoteTransmissionRequest = false, IsExtendedId = true }); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } private static void can_MessageAvailable(ControllerAreaNetwork sender, ControllerAreaNetwork.MessageAvailableEventArgs e) { var received = sender.ReadMessage(); var data = string.Empty; for (int i = 0; i < received.Length; i++) data += \"0x\" + received.Data[i].ToString(\"x2\") + \" \"; Debug.Print(\" CAN Message \"); Debug.Print(\"-----------------\"); Debug.Print(\" ID: \" + received.ArbitrationId.ToString()); Debug.Print(\" Time: \" + received.TimeStamp.ToString()); Debug.Print(\" RTR: \" + received.IsRemoteTransmissionRequest.ToString()); Debug.Print(\" EID: \" + received.IsExtendedId.ToString()); Debug.Print(\"Length: \" + received.Length.ToString()); Debug.Print(\" Data: \" + data); Debug.Print(\"\"); } private static void can_ErrorReceived(ControllerAreaNetwork sender, ControllerAreaNetwork.ErrorReceivedEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Error on CAN: \" + e.Error.ToString()); } } CAN Bit Timing Settings The following CAN bit timing parameters were calculated for a SITCore driving the SN65HVD230 CAN transceiver chip.

    "title": "Digital Inputs",
    "keywords": "Digital Inputs Digital inputs sense if the state of its pin is high or low based on the voltage. Every pin has a maximum & minimum supported voltages. For example, the typical minimum voltage on most pins is 0 volts -- a negative voltage may damage the pin or the processor. Also, the maximum that can be supplied to most pins must be less than the processor power source voltage. Since most processors run on 3.3V, the highest voltage a pin should see is 3.3V; however, some processors that are powered by 3.3V are 5V tolerant and are capable of accepting up to 5V on their inputs. Check the product's or the processor's manual for the tolerance level. Warning 5V-tolerant doesn't mean the processor can be powered by 5V. Only the input pins can tolerate 5V. InputPort An InputPort object is used to handle digital input pins. Most pins on the processor can be input or output. Unconnected input pins are \"floating\". When a pin is an input and is not connected, it is open for any surrounding noise, which can make the pin high or low. To take care of this issue, modern processors include internal weak pull-down or pull-up resistors, that are usually controlled by software. Enabling the pull-up resistor will pull the pin high. Note that the pull-up resistor doesn't make a pin high but it pulls it high. If nothing is connected then the pin is high by default. External resistors can be added as well. In this example, a button is connected between ground and the input pin. We will also enable the pull-up resistor. This means that the pin will be high (pull-up) when button is not pressed and low (connected to ground) when the button is pressed. We will read the status of the button and pass its state to the LED. Note that the pin is high when the button is not pressed (pulled-high) and it is low when the button is pressed. This means the LED will turn off when the button is pressed. The following code requires the Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware assembly. Consult the device schematics or manuals for the proper pin numbers. using System.Threading; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { public static void Main() { OutputPort LED; InputPort Button; LED = new OutputPort(Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin1, true); Button = new InputPort(Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin2, false, Port.ResistorMode.PullUp); while (true) { LED.Write(Button.Read()); Thread.Sleep(10); } } } Interrupt Port In the previous example, the program just looped, and looped, and looped -- each time checking the status of the pin attached to the button. The pin is checked maybe a million times before/after the button is pressed! Interrupt ports allows us to set a method that will be executed when the button is pressed (when pin is low for example). We can set the interrupt to fire (call the method) on many state changes on the pin: when a pin is low or maybe when it is high. The most common use is the \"on change.\" The change from low to high or high to low creates a signal edge. The rising edge occurs when the signal rises from low to high. The falling edge happen when the signal falls from high to low. For a more in-depth understanding of the difference between the \"change\" interrupt versus a \"level\" interrupt, use wikipedia -- the two articles of relevance are found by searching for \"Interrupt Port\" and \"edge level transition.\" In the example below, we are using the low edge to detect a button press. \"IntButton_OnInterrupt\" will automatically run when button is pressed. The following code requires the Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware assembly. Consult the device schematic or manual for pin numbers. using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; using System; using System.Threading; public class Program { public static void Main() { InterruptPort IntButton = new InterruptPort(Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin1, false, Port.ResistorMode.PullUp, Port.InterruptMode.InterruptEdgeLow); IntButton.OnInterrupt += new NativeEventHandler(IntButton_OnInterrupt); // Other code can be added here // ... // We are just going to sleep in this example! Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } static void IntButton_OnInterrupt(uint port, uint state, DateTime time) { Debug.Print(\"Button Pressed\"); } } When creating the new InterruptPort object, the second argument indicates whether the glitch filter is enabled (true) or disabled (false). This is typically needed when using the interrupt feature to debounce the button. Not enabling this feature may cause the button to trigger more than one event, even though the button is pressed once. Tip In the event handler, like the one above : ...OnInterrupt(uint port, uint state..., the state argument is the state of the Pin after the edge transition. I.e. on a low to high edge, state will be high (true); likewise for high to low transitions. Tristate Port If we want a pin to be an input and output, what can we do? A pin can never be in and out simultaneously but we can make it output to set something and then make it input to read a response back. One way is to \"Dispose\" of the pin. We make an output port, use it and then dispose it; then we can make the pin input and read it. NETMF supports a better option called a Tristate port. Tristate means three states -- input, output low and output high. One minor issue about tristate pins is that if a pin is set to output and then you set it to output again an exception will occur. One common work-around for this is to check the direction of the pin before changing it. The direction of the pin is in its property \"Active\" where false means input and true is output. The code below requires the Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware assembly. Tip Due to internal design, TristatePorts will only work with interrupt capable digital pins. Warning Be careful not to have the pin connected to a switch then set the pin to output. using System.Threading; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { static void MakePinOutput(TristatePort port) { if (port.Active == false) port.Active = true; } static void MakePinInput(TristatePort port) { if (port.Active == true) port.Active = false; } public static void Main() { TristatePort TriPin = new TristatePort(Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin6, false, false, Port.ResistorMode.PullUp); MakePinOutput(TriPin); TriPin.Write(true); Debug.Print(\"Write to output pin completed.\"); Debug.Print(\"Changing to input pin\"); MakePinInput(TriPin); Debug.Print(\"The input pin state is: \" + TriPin.Read().ToString()); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } }"

High can also be called \"true\" or \"one;\" low can be called \"false\" or \"zero\". If the processor is powered off of 3.3 V, then the state high means that there is 3.3 V on the output pin. It is not going to be exactly 3.3 V but very close. When the pin is set to low then it is voltage is very close to zero volts. Warning Never connect two output pins together. If they are connected and one is high and the other is low, the entire processor can be damaged. The digital pins on micro-controllers are very weak. They can not be used to drive devices that require a lot of power. Tip All the examples shown below require the Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware assembly.

    "href": "software/netmf/tutorials/files.html",
    "title": "Files",
    "keywords": "Files The file system features in NETMF are very similar to full .NET. There are no limits on file counts or sizes other than the limits of the FAT file system itself. NETMF supports FAT16 and FAT32. With a few minor changes, NETMF file system access can be tested from within the Microsoft NETMF emulator. Changes include removing any of the GHI Electronics library dependencies. Unlike full .NET, NETMF does require mounting of media. NETMF also handles media names differently than full .NET. Media name differences are easily handled by accessing the root directory name at runtime and then using that name. Consequently, most online examples of how to use .NET to access files on PCs can be used with NETMF. In NETMF, other than differences for specific physical characteristics, usage of SD/MMC cards and USB memory devices are identical to .NET. This document splits it's examples into two sets. One for SD/MMC Card file system access and the other for USB Mass Storage. The core file operations (open, read, write, etc.) are identical between the two. Warning The file system does a lot of data buffering internally to speed up file access time and to increase the life of flash media. When you write data to a file, it is often saved somewhere in internal buffers rather than being written immediately to the media. To make sure the data is stored on the media, you need to flush the data. Flushing (or closing) a file is the only way to guarantee that the data you are trying to write is on the actual media. In addition to the file data there is other information, such as directory information, that may not be written to the media when the file is flushed. For example, if you delete a file and remove the card from the system, the file is probably not actually erased because the directory structure was not flushed. Under current versions of .NET Micro Framework, there can be a variable time delay before the buffers are actually written to the media when using the FileStream's Flush method. This delay can reportedly be as long as a minute (see: https://netmf.codeplex.com/workitem/2149 ). To guarantee that the file buffers and the meta-data are written to the media you need to flush the volume: VolumeInfo.GetVolumes()[0].FlushAll() -or- Microsoft.SPOT.IO.VolumeInfo(\"\\SD\").FlushAll() . Ideally, you would unmount the media before it is removed from the system. This may not be always possible -- FlushAll will guarantee your data is saved Tip The SD/MMC Card examples shown below require the GHI.Hardware, Microsoft.SPOT.IO, and System.IO assemblies. Some Microsoft documentation class descriptions, such as for Directory, place the library code in the mscorlib assembly; however, it is found in the System.IO assembly. SD Card: Show Files in Root Directory This example assumes the card is already inserted; it lists all files available in the root directory. Note Some SD card sockets/interfaces have an internal switch that closes when a card is inserted or ejected. Utilizing the switch is shown in the \" SD Card: Media Detection \" example further down on this page. using System.IO; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; using Microsoft.SPOT.IO; using GHI.IO; using GHI.IO.Storage; class Program { public static void Main() { // ... // assume SD card is inserted // Create a new storage device // NETMF only allows one SD card // to be supported at a time. SDCard sd_card = new SDCard(); // this is a non-blocking call // it fires the RemovableMedia.Insert event after // the mount is finished. sd_card.Mount(); // for some cases, a simple sleep might suffice // This example just waits on the event before proceeding // (After first time firing of the event, you may want // to disable the handler or re-assign it bool fs_ready = false; RemovableMedia.Insert += (a, b) => { fs_ready = true; }; while (! fs_ready) { System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(50); } // Assume one storage device is available, access it through // NETMF and display the available files and folders: Debug.Print(\"Getting files and folders:\"); if (VolumeInfo.GetVolumes()[0].IsFormatted) { string rootDirectory = VolumeInfo.GetVolumes()[0].RootDirectory; string[] files = Directory.GetFiles(rootDirectory); string[] folders = Directory.GetDirectories(rootDirectory); Debug.Print(\"Files available on \" + rootDirectory + \":\"); for (int i = 0; i < files.Length; i++) Debug.Print(files[i]); Debug.Print(\"Folders available on \" + rootDirectory + \":\"); for (int i = 0; i < folders.Length; i++) Debug.Print(folders[i]); } else { Debug.Print(\"Storage is not formatted. \" + \"Format on PC with FAT32/FAT16 first!\"); } // Unmount when done sd_card.Unmount(); } } SD Card: Writing Files There is more than one way to open files. I will only cover FileStream objects. This example will open a file and write a string to it. Since FileStream will only take byte arrays, we need to convert our string to a byte array. using System.Threading; using System.Text; using Microsoft.SPOT; using System.IO; using Microsoft.SPOT.IO; using GHI.IO.Storage; public class Program { static void Main() { // if necessary, check that SD is present here... SDCard sd_card = new SDCard(); sd_card.Mount(); bool fs_ready = false; RemovableMedia.Insert += (a, b) => { fs_ready = true; }; while (! fs_ready ) { System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1); } // Assume only one storage device is available // and that the media is formatted string rootDirectory = VolumeInfo.GetVolumes()[0].RootDirectory; FileStream FileHandle = new FileStream(rootDirectory + @\"\\hello.txt\", FileMode.Create); byte[] data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"This string will go in the file!\"); FileHandle.Write(data, 0, data.Length); FileHandle.Close(); sd_card.Unmount(); } } SD Card: Reading a File Take the SD Card used in the last example, put it in a PC and you will see the file. For this example, we use the same SD Card written to by the last example. The file is opened and read to verify its contents. using System.Threading; using System.Text; using Microsoft.SPOT; using System.IO; using Microsoft.SPOT.IO; using GHI.IO.Storage; public class Program { static void Main() { // ... If desired, check if SD is inserted // SD Card is inserted // Create a new storage device SDCard sd_card = new SDCard(); // Mount the file system sd_card.Mount(); bool fs_ready = false; RemovableMedia.Insert += (a, b) => { fs_ready = true; }; while (!fs_ready) { System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1); } // Assume one storage device is available, // access it through NETMF string rootDirectory = VolumeInfo.GetVolumes()[0].RootDirectory; FileStream FileHandle = new FileStream(rootDirectory + @\"\\hello.txt\", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read); byte[] data = new byte[100]; int read_count = FileHandle.Read(data, 0, data.Length); FileHandle.Close(); Debug.Print(\"The size of data read is: \" + read_count.ToString()); Debug.Print(\"Data from file:\"); Debug.Print(new string(Encoding.UTF8.GetChars(data), 0, read_count)); sd_card.Unmount(); } } SD Card: Media Detection The previous examples assumed that the card was already inserted and mostly ignored whether that media was formatted (contained a file system). The following example shows an application without such assumptions; additionally, it demonstrates the Format method. Together, InsertEventHandler , EjectEventHandler , and IsSDCardPresent are used to respond to physical card activities, which in turn are used to control mounting ( Mount , Unmount ) of the card. Once the card is mounted, the file-system can be used. using System; using System.IO; using System.Threading; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.IO; using GHI.IO.Storage; public class Program { // evt is used to avoid the possibility that accesses to the // mounted file system do not occur until mount() // is fully done. private static AutoResetEvent evt = new AutoResetEvent(false); //Make sure to set the pin to your sd card detect pin. private static InputPort sdCardDetect = new InputPort(Cpu.Pin.GPIO_NONE, false, Port.ResistorMode.Disabled); public static void Main() { RemovableMedia.Insert += new InsertEventHandler(RemovableMedia_Insert); RemovableMedia.Eject += new EjectEventHandler(RemovableMedia_Eject); // Start auto mounting thread new Thread(SDMountThread).Start(); evt.WaitOne(); // yield here until mounting and initializing is finished // Your program goes here // ... } // This event is fired by unmount; not neccesarily by physical ejection of media static void RemovableMedia_Eject(object sender, MediaEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"SD card unmounted, eject event fired\"); // as desired signal other thread(s) in application // that unmount occurred } static void RemovableMedia_Insert(object sender, MediaEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Insert event fired; SD card mount is finished.\"); // insert code here for anything the program wants to do immediately // after mounting occurs... if (e.Volume.IsFormatted) { Debug.Print(\"Available folders:\"); string[] strs = Directory.GetDirectories(e.Volume.RootDirectory); for (int i = 0; i < strs.Length; i++) Debug.Print(strs[i]); Debug.Print(\"Available files:\"); strs = Directory.GetFiles(e.Volume.RootDirectory); for (int i = 0; i < strs.Length; i++) Debug.Print(strs[i]); } else { Debug.Print(\"SD card is not formatted. Formatting...\"); // VolumeInfo is the class that contains volume information for a specific // media. // .GetVolumes()[0] aquires the first volume on the device. Change the // index for different volumes. // .Format(\"FAT\", 0); Selects the \"FAT\" file system as the format type. VolumeInfo.GetVolumes()[0].Format(\"FAT\", 0); } evt.Set(); // proceed with other processing } public static void SDMountThread() { SDCard SD = null; const int POLL_TIME = 500; // check every 500 millisecond bool sdExists; while (true) { try { // If SD card was removed while mounting, it may throw exceptions. sdExists = sdCardDetect.Read(); // make sure it is fully inserted and stable if (sdExists) { Thread.Sleep(50); sdExists = sdCardDetect.Read(); } if (sdExists && SD == null) { SD = new SDCard(); SD.Mount(); } else if (!sdExists && SD != null) { SD.Unmount(); SD.Dispose(); SD = null; } } catch { if (SD != null) { SD.Dispose(); SD = null; } } Thread.Sleep(POLL_TIME); } } } USB Mass Storage Devices USB mass storage devices, such as memory sticks and card readers are supported by GHI's NETMF devices. If you compare the following example with those above for SD Cards, you will see how easy it is to program for one, the other, or both with virtually identical code. using System; using System.Threading; using System.IO; using Microsoft.SPOT; using System.Text; using Microsoft.SPOT.IO; using GHI.Usb; using GHI.Usb.Host; using GHI.IO.Storage; public class Program { // evt is used to avoid the possibility that accesses to the // mounted file system do not occur until mount() // is fully done. private static AutoResetEvent evt = new AutoResetEvent(false); private static MassStorage usb_storage; private static string rootDirectory; public static void Main() { RemovableMedia.Insert += new InsertEventHandler(RemovableMedia_Insert); RemovableMedia.Eject += new EjectEventHandler(RemovableMedia_Eject); // Unlike SD Card detection, the USB Host Controller sends an // event when a Mass Storage device is plugged-in. Controller.MassStorageConnected += (sender, massStorage) => { usb_storage = massStorage; usb_storage.Mount(); // fires the insert event when finished }; Controller.Start(); evt.WaitOne(); // yield here until mounting and initializing is finished byte[] data; // write using (var FileHandle = new FileStream(rootDirectory + @\"\\hello.txt\", FileMode.Create)) { data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"This string will go in the file!\"); FileHandle.Write(data, 0, data.Length); } // read int read_count; using (var FileHandle = new FileStream(rootDirectory + @\"\\hello.txt\", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)) { data = new byte[100]; read_count = FileHandle.Read(data, 0, data.Length); } Debug.Print(\"The size of data we read is: \" + read_count.ToString()); Debug.Print(\"Data from file:\"); Debug.Print(new string(Encoding.UTF8.GetChars(data), 0, read_count)); usb_storage.Unmount(); } // This event is fired by unmount static void RemovableMedia_Eject(object sender, MediaEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"USB unmounted, eject event fired\"); } static void RemovableMedia_Insert(object sender, MediaEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Insert event fired; USB Storage mount is finished.\"); if (e.Volume.IsFormatted) { rootDirectory = e.Volume.RootDirectory; Debug.Print(\"Available folders:\"); string[] strs = Directory.GetDirectories(e.Volume.RootDirectory); for (int i = 0; i < strs.Length; i++) Debug.Print(strs[i]); Debug.Print(\"Available files:\"); strs = Directory.GetFiles(e.Volume.RootDirectory); for (int i = 0; i < strs.Length; i++) Debug.Print(strs[i]); } else { Debug.Print(\"Media is not formatted.

This shouldn't be an issue since FAT12 is no longer in use."

    "title": "Graphics",
    "keywords": "Graphics Introduction NETMF provides excellent support for graphics through the Bitmap class (that we also supplement with our Glide library). It can draw various shapes, text, and images from BMPs, JPGs, and GIFs -- which can be obtained from the file system, network, or resources. When drawing on a bitmap, everything is rendered on an in-memory object that can be quite large depending on your screen size. To transfer a bitmap object from memory to the screen, we need to call Flush on the bitmap object. Flush will only work if the size of the bitmap is exactly the size of the screen. If it is any other size, no image will be displayed. Non-Native Support Some smaller devices do not have a built in LCD controller. As a result, they can only use displays through a different type of bus, often SPI. Depending on your exact display, you may need to call a display specific function in its driver to draw on the scree. However, some SPI displays do support the Flush method on bitmaps, so be sure to consult your display documentation. Display Configuration In order to use a display, you must configure it. You can select the display type from FEZ Config on the LCD Configuration tab or you can execute the below code (make sure to select your actual display). After you set the configuration, the device must reboot for it to take effect. The Save method returns whether or not a reboot is needed. If you are using a display that is not present under GHIDisplay, you will need to configure the properties on the Display object instead of calling the Populate method. using GHI.Processor; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { public static void Main() { Display.Populate(Display.GHIDisplay.DisplayCP7); if (Display.Save()) PowerState.RebootDevice(false); //Display is now configured. } } Drawing The following example draws a line and an ellipse on the screen. The assemblies Microsoft.SPOT.Graphics and Microsoft.SPOT.TinyCore are required. using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Presentation; using Microsoft.SPOT.Presentation.Media; public class Program { public static void Main() { Bitmap lcd = new Bitmap(SystemMetrics.ScreenWidth, SystemMetrics.ScreenHeight); lcd.DrawLine(Colors.Green, 1, 20, 20, 40, 40); lcd.DrawEllipse(Colors.Blue, 5, 5, 5, 5); lcd.Flush(); } } Text The following code shows how to display text using NETMF. Since resources depend on your project's default namespace, make sure that you change the namespace in this example to match your namespace. If you do not currently have a font resource in your project, NETMF ships with two default fonts that you can add as a resource found in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft .NET Micro Framework\\v4.3\\Fonts. You can find the NinaB font that we use below in that folder. using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Presentation; using Microsoft.SPOT.Presentation.Media; namespace your_namespace { public class Program { public static void Main() { Font font = Resources.GetFont(Resources.FontResources.NinaB); Bitmap lcd = new Bitmap(SystemMetrics.ScreenWidth, SystemMetrics.ScreenHeight); lcd.DrawText(\"Hello, World!\", font, Colors.White, 0, 0); lcd.Flush(); } } } Adding new fonts to your application is very easy. TTL fonts can be converted to the simple font format used in NETMF using the TinyFont tool SPI Displays If you are using a G80 or Cerb based device and a SPI display, you can configure the device so that when you call Flush on a bitmap, it is automatically sent to the display. If the ControlPin is provided, the draw window will automatically be set, the data byte will be sent, and the ControlPin will be set high for you when you call Flush. The display will also be initialized on the first call to Flush. Additionally, the backlight pin will automatically be set high if provided on the first call to Flush. Lastly, if ResetPin is provided, it will be toggled before initialization. If your device does not have enough memory to create a bitmap for the entire screen, you can create a smaller one and only draw to a subset of the display. You can set the draw window on the display to match that new size and pick which position it is drawn at. Doing this multiple times allows you to draw the entire screen by moving the draw window around and redrawing the bitmap. The below example shows how to do this on the FEZ Cerberus and requires the GHI.Hardware, Microsoft.SPOT.Graphics, and Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware assemblies. Make sure you properly set any pins other configuration below for your actual device bearing in mind the above considerations. If you are not using the DisplayN18, you must configure the display before first use and set the draw window before you call Flush every time. using GHI.Pins; using GHI.Processor; using GHI.Utilities; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; using Microsoft.SPOT.Presentation.Media; public class Program { public static void Main() { Display.Width = 128; Display.Height = 160; Display.Type = Display.DisplayType.Spi; Display.CurrentRotation = Display.Rotation.Normal; Display.BitmapFormat = Bitmaps.Format.Bpp16BgrLe; Display.SpiModule = FEZCerberus.Socket5.SpiModule; Display.ChipSelectPin = FEZCerberus.Socket5.Pin6; Display.ResetPin = FEZCerberus.Socket5.Pin3; Display.BacklightPin = FEZCerberus.Socket5.Pin4; Display.ControlPin = FEZCerberus.Socket5.Pin5; Display.Save(); var bmp = new Bitmap(Display.Width, Display.Height); bmp.DrawEllipse(Colors.Red, 5, 5, 5, 5); bmp.DrawEllipse(Colors.Green, 15, 5, 5, 5); bmp.DrawEllipse(Colors.Blue, 25, 5, 5, 5); } } Gadgeteer When using Gadgeteer display modules, the SimpleGraphics interface is provided for you. It provides an API that is a bit easier to use than regular NETMF bitmaps. It is available as the SimpleGraphics property on every display. The below example shows how to display an ellipse, line, and some text. Make sure that you change the namespace to match yours. Gadgeteer programs automatically add the NinaB font to your project so you do not need to worry about adding it yourself. using GT = Gadgeteer; namespace your_namespace { public partial class Program { void ProgramStarted() { this.displayCP7.SimpleGraphics.DisplayEllipse(GT.Color.Red, 1, GT.Color.Red, 5, 5, 5, 5); this.displayCP7.SimpleGraphics.DisplayLine(GT.Color.Blue, 1, 20, 20, 40, 40); this.displayCP7.SimpleGraphics.DisplayText(\"Hello, World!\", Resources.GetFont(Resources.FontResources.NinaB), GT.Color.Green, 60, 60); } } }"

    "title": "I2C",
    "keywords": "I2C I2C (pronounced eye-squared-sea, or eye-two-sea) was originally developed by Phillips to allow multiple chipsets to communicate on a 2-wire bus in home consumer devices. It has a master and one or more slaves sharing the same data bus. Instead of selecting the slaves using a digital pin like SPI (consuming an additional I/O pin), I2C uses an addressing mechanism to communicate to the selected device. Before data is transferred, the master sends out a 7-bit address address of the slave device it wants to communicate with. It also sends one bit indicating whether it wants to send data to the device or receive data from the device. When a slave sees its address on the bus, it will acknowledge its presence. At this point, the master can send or receive data. The master will start data transfers with a \"start\" condition before it sends any address or data and then end it with \"stop\" condition. The I2C uses two wires to communicate between the I2C Master and the I2C device. These two wires are known as the SDA and SCL lines. SDA stands for Serial Data, and SCL is Serial Clock. The I2C NETMF driver is based on transactions. If we want to read from a register on a sensor, we would first need to send it the register number we wish to read from, and then we need to read the register. Those are two transactions; a write followed by a read. Addressing One very important point about I2C is that I2C devices have a 7-bit address, but 8-bits are sent on the wire in the \"control byte\" when communicating with the I2C bus. The 8th bit tells the device whether the operation will be a read operation (the 8th bit is a 1) or a write operation (the 8th bit is a 0). When discussing I2C you should always make sure you are clear about the 7-bit address that your device uses, rather than stating your 8-bit read or write address. Software I2C When using I2C, it is highly recommended that you use the built-in hardware support for I2C. In some cases though it may be necessary to have another I2C bus or it is necessary to use specific pins that are not I2C pins. In this case, I2C can be handled completely in software, though performance will be lower. The GHI Electronics libraries include a software I2C implementation in the GHI.Hardware assembly (GHI.IO.SoftwareI2CBus). An I2C Example This example will read the value of the register on an I2C device with the 7-bit address of 0x38. As discussed above, you first have to write the register number you want to read, two in this case, and then read the value back. using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { public static void Main() { //create I2C object //note that the netmf i2cdevice configuration requires a 7-bit address! It set the 8th R/W bit automatically. I2CDevice.Configuration con = new I2CDevice.Configuration(0x38, 400); I2CDevice MyI2C = new I2CDevice(con); // Create transactions // We need 2 in this example, we are reading from the device // First transaction is writing the \"read command\" // Second transaction is reading the data I2CDevice.I2CTransaction[] xActions = new I2CDevice.I2CTransaction[2]; // create write buffer (we need one byte) byte[] RegisterNum = new byte[1] { 2 }; xActions[0] = I2CDevice.CreateWriteTransaction(RegisterNum); // create read buffer to read the register byte[] RegisterValue = new byte[1]; xActions[1] = I2CDevice.CreateReadTransaction(RegisterValue); // Now we access the I2C bus using a timeout of one second // if the execute command returns zero, the transaction failed (this // is a good check to make sure that you are communicating with the device correctly // and don�t have a wiring issue or other problem with the I2C device) if (MyI2C.Execute(xActions, 1000) == 0) { Debug.Print(\"Failed to perform I2C transaction\"); } else { Debug.Print(\"Register value: \" + RegisterValue[0].ToString()); } } } Multiple Devices The I2C object on NETMF is a representation of the \"bus\" and not the \"device\" so you can't construct multiple I2C objects. To access multiple I2C devices you need to have multiple configurations and then when accessing device \"A\" we need to use configuration \"A\" and when accessing device \"B\" we need to use configuration \"B\". using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { public static void Main() { //create I2C Device object representing both devices on our bus I2CDevice.Configuration conDeviceA = new I2CDevice.Configuration(0x38, 400); I2CDevice.Configuration conDeviceB = new I2CDevice.Configuration(0x48, 400); //create I2C Bus object using one of the devices on the bus I2CDevice MyI2C = new I2CDevice(conDeviceA); // Note you could have chosen to create the bus using the conDeviceB parameter, which ever you choose it will be the \"selected\" device on the bus to start with. Here's how you would do that: // I2CDevice MyI2C = new I2CDevice(conDeviceB); //create transactions (we need 2 in this example) I2CDevice.I2CTransaction[] xActions = new I2CDevice.I2CTransaction[2]; // create write buffer (we need one byte) byte[] RegisterNum = new byte[1] { 2 }; xActions[0] = I2CDevice.CreateWriteTransaction(RegisterNum); // create read buffer to read the register byte[] RegisterValue = new byte[1]; xActions[1] = I2CDevice.CreateReadTransaction(RegisterValue); // Explicitly set the I2C bus to access device A by setting the I2C Config to the Device A's config. MyI2C.Config = conDeviceA; if (MyI2C.Execute(xActions, 1000) == 0) { Debug.Print(\"Failed to perform I2C transaction\"); } else { Debug.Print(\"Register value: \" + RegisterValue[0].ToString()); } // Explicitly set the I2C bus to access device B by setting the I2C Config to the Device B's config. MyI2C.Config = conDeviceB; if (MyI2C.Execute(xActions, 1000) == 0) { Debug.Print(\"Failed to perform I2C transaction\"); } else { Debug.Print(\"Register value: \" + RegisterValue[0].ToString()); } } }"

    "title": "In-Field Update",
    "keywords": "In-Field Update One of GHI Electronics's additions to NETMF includes the In-Field Update (IFU) class allowing devices to be updated in the field. Updates can be obtained over the network or via USB memory, an SD card, or even through a serial port. File encryption and integrity checking can be implemented if desired. Once the data is available, it is passed on to IFU and then stored internally in RAM. Once all of the data is received and loaded by the developer, a single call will wipe the flash and write the new files. Only the regions that are being updated are erased. Warning The final stage will erase the flash and write the new data. This can take some time depending on the board. Losing power during this process will cause the update to fail and require the device to be updated manually. Extracting an Existing Application Creating a hex file to flash to your deployed board is easy. For example, if you have a board in the field (mall kiosk, traffic signal, etc) that is difficult to access, just deploy the new version of your program to another board of the same type. Then open MFDeploy, select USB, and select Target > Application Deployment > Create Application Deployment as shown below. Tip If you would like the next version of your application to have the same update ability, be sure to include the update code in it as well. Now select the name of the file that you would like to use and where to save it. Once this is done, you can place this file on an SD card and insert it into your device, or you can send it to you device over a network. The next section will demonstrate how to load the files and perform the update. Getting Started The following example shows you how to load data into IFU and then flash the device. It requires the GHI.Hardware assembly and assumes that you have already mounted an SD card. Since firmware files can large and often cannot be held in entirely in memory we only load portions of the file at a time. using GHI.Processor; using System.IO; public class Program { public const int BLOCK_SIZE = 65536; public static void FlashFirmware() { // Reserve the memory needed to buffer the update. // A lot of RAM is needed so it is recommended to do this at the program start.

LoadFile(\"\\\\SD\\\\Config.hex\", InFieldUpdate.Types.Configuration); LoadFile(\"\\\\SD\\\\Firmware.hex\", InFieldUpdate.Types.Firmware); LoadFile(\"\\\\SD\\\\Firmware2.hex\", InFieldUpdate.Types.Firmware); //Only if your device has two firmware files. // This method will copy The new firmware from RAM to FLASH. // This function will not return but will reset the system when done. // Power loss before this function resets the system will result in corrupted firmware. // A manual update will be needed if this method fails (due to power loss for example). InFieldUpdate.FlashAndReset(); } public static void LoadFile(string filename, InFieldUpdate.Types type) { using (var stream = new FileStream(filename, FileMode.Open)) { var data = new byte[BLOCK_SIZE]; for (int i = 0; i < stream.Length / BLOCK_SIZE; i++) { stream.Read(data, 0, BLOCK_SIZE); InFieldUpdate.Load(type, data, BLOCK_SIZE); } stream.Read(data, 0, (int)stream.Length % BLOCK_SIZE); InFieldUpdate.Load(type, data, (int)stream.Length % BLOCK_SIZE); } } }"

    "title": "Networking",
    "keywords": "Networking Introduction Networks are an essential part of our everyday lives. Almost every home is connected to a network (the Internet) and most businesses can't function without an internal network (LAN or WiFi) that is connected to an external network (the Internet). All these networks have a standard for communication: TCP/IP. There are actually a few protocols that handle different tasks in the network: DNS, DHCP, IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, PPP, and others. In code, you create what is called a socket. A socket allows communication between your computer and one or more other endpoints (usually remote computers). Sockets can be TCP, UDP, and others. Socket support in NETMF is very similar to the full .NET Framework. Tip When working with networking, you may sometimes receive socket exceptions that look like \"10054\". NETMF uses the same error codes as WinSock on the desktop, so a quick search can tell you what that code means. For example,10054 means connection reset. Getting started with WiFi Since GHI Electronics's devices can provide multiple network interfaces (only one can be used at a time, however), you must initialize the interface you wish to use. To do so, you must create the interface object, open it, configure any network settings, and, in the case of WiFi, join a network. In the below example, you can see that we are using DHCP and dynamic DNS. This allows a lot of the configuration to be done automatically, depending on your network setup. (Static IP and static DNS also work.) Once you join a network and have been issued a valid IP Address, the network is ready to use. Make sure you enter your network key in the proper format. WPA/WPA2 keys are the literal string value while WEP keys are the hex digits without the leading 0x. The following code requires the GHI.Networking, Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware, and Microsoft.SPOT.Net assemblies. Make sure that you update the pins in the constructor to match your hardware setup. using GHI.Networking; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; using Microsoft.SPOT.Net.NetworkInformation; using System; using System.Net; using System.Threading; public class Program { private static WiFiRS9110 netif; public static void Main() { NetworkChange.NetworkAvailabilityChanged += NetworkChange_NetworkAvailabilityChanged; NetworkChange.NetworkAddressChanged += NetworkChange_NetworkAddressChanged; netif = new WiFiRS9110(SPI.SPI_module.SPI1, Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin1, Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin2, Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin3); netif.Open(); netif.EnableDhcp(); netif.EnableDynamicDns(); netif.Join(\"SSID\", \"Password\"); while (netif.IPAddress == \"0.0.0.0\") { Debug.Print(\"Waiting for DHCP\"); Thread.Sleep(250); } //The network is now ready to use. } private static void NetworkChange_NetworkAddressChanged(object sender, Microsoft.SPOT.EventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Network address changed\"); } private static void NetworkChange_NetworkAvailabilityChanged(object sender, NetworkAvailabilityEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Network availability: \" + e.IsAvailable.ToString()); } } Wired Ethernet If you want to use a physical Ethernet connection, you can use our SPI based ENC28 or the built in Ethernet adapter. Initializing the network is similar to WiFi in either case, except you do not join a network as seen below. netif = new EthernetENC28J60(SPI.SPI_module.SPI1, Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin1, Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin2, Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin3); netif.Open(); netif.EnableDhcp(); netif.EnableDynamicDns(); while (netif.IPAddress == \"0.0.0.0\") { Debug.Print(\"Waiting for DHCP\"); Thread.Sleep(250); } //The network is now ready to use. netif = new EthernetBuiltIn(); netif.Open(); netif.EnableDhcp(); netif.EnableDynamicDns(); while (netif.IPAddress == \"0.0.0.0\") { Debug.Print(\"Waiting for DHCP\"); Thread.Sleep(250); } //The network is now ready to use. HTTP communication Once you configure a network interface, you probably want to start communicating over the network. One of the easiest ways to do this is through HTTP. After you have received an IP Address (as shown above), you can create an HTTP request to a URL and then receive its response. What you do with that data is up to you. Make sure the result buffer is larger enough to hold the response or process the data as you read it. byte[] result = new byte[65536]; int read = 0; using (var req = HttpWebRequest.Create(\"url to query\") as HttpWebRequest) { using (var res = req.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse) { using (var stream = res.GetResponseStream()) { do { read = stream.Read(result, 0, result.Length); Thread.Sleep(20); } while (read != 0); } } } //The result array now contains the data received from the remote server. mIP For those who want greater control over the networking stack, there is the mIP C# library available at http://mip.codeplex.com/ It is a full networking stack allowing you to modify it to suit your needs, something not easily done with the built in stack. PPP You can use the provided PPP class to communicate with serial PPP devices such as cellular or regular modems that provide access to the internet. After you configure your device over a serial port (potentially using AT commands that differ for every device), you pass that port and any authentication parameters to our PPP class and then, once the PPP connection is established with the device, you can use the regular NETMF networking functionality to access the internet or your network. The below example shows the basic initialization, AT commands, and PPP commands needed to access the network using a SIM908 cellular modem. You must provide your own SIM card and correctly set the APN and COM port based on your setup. The code requires the GHI.Networking, Microsoft.SPOT.SerialPort, and Microsoft.SPOT.Net assemblies. Different AT commands will be needed for different modems. using GHI.Networking; using Microsoft.SPOT.Net.NetworkInformation; using System.IO.Ports; using System.Text; using System.Threading; public class Program { private static AutoResetEvent evt; private static void Main() { evt = new AutoResetEvent(false); NetworkChange.NetworkAvailabilityChanged += NetworkChange_NetworkAvailabilityChanged; using (var port = new SerialPort(\"YOUR UART PORT\", 115200, Parity.None, 8, StopBits.One)) { port.Open(); port.DiscardInBuffer(); port.DiscardOutBuffer(); SendATCommand(port, \"AT+CGDCONT=2,\\\"IP\\\",\\\"YOUR APN\\\"\"); SendATCommand(port, \"ATDT*99***2#\"); using (var netif = new PPPSerialModem(port)) { netif.Open(); netif.Connect(PPPSerialModem.AuthenticationType.Pap, \"\", \"\"); evt.WaitOne(); //The network is now ready to use. } } } private static void NetworkChange_NetworkAvailabilityChanged(object sender, NetworkAvailabilityEventArgs e) { if (e.IsAvailable) evt.Set(); } private static void SendATCommand(SerialPort port, string command) { var sendBuffer = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(command + \"\\r\"); var readBuffer = new byte[256]; var read = 0; port.Write(sendBuffer, 0, sendBuffer.Length); while (true) { read += port.Read(readBuffer, read, readBuffer.Length - read); var response = new string(Encoding.UTF8.GetChars(readBuffer, 0, read)); if (response.IndexOf(\"OK\") != -1 || response.IndexOf(\"CONNECT\") != -1) break; } } } SSL SSL allows you to secure the communications between your device and a remote server. Currently only SSL2, SSL3, and TLS1.0 are supported. Your NETMF device must have the proper time set for SSL to function. Unlike your PC, NETMF devices do not maintain a database of root certificates which are used to verify a remote server is who it says it is. As a result, you must manually include the root certificate for the site you are connecting to in your project. One easy way to accomplish this is to go to the site in your browser, click the padlock icon near the address bar, view the certificate, and then go to the Certification Path tab, click the top most (the root) certificate entry, view it, then under Details, copy it to a file, making sure to use base 64 encoding. Add that file as a resource to your project. Unfortunately, this will not always work. Some sites present different certificates based on who it detects it asking for them. Additionally, some certificates may be cross signed where there is another root you must use. You can try to search online for the actual root certificate or use Wireshark or a similar program. To use Wireshark, capture the traffic from the device when you try to connect to the desired site. It should fail since you do not have the correct certificate. Early in the conversation, after the \"Server Hello\" packet, find a \"Certificate\" packet. Under the SSL > Handshake Protocol > Certificates, find the very last entry. Make sure it is its own issuer. If not, you must use the issuer as the root certificate. For example, when connecting to https://www.google.com/ , the very last certificate is GeoTrust Global CA. In the browser, it is issued by itself. In Wireshark from our device however, it is actually issued by Equifax Secure Certificate Authority. Once you have added it to your project, you can use the below code to communicate with that site: just pass in the URL you want to download and the root certificate. It requires the Microsoft.SPOT.Native and System.Http assemblies. When connecting to different sites, make sure to repeat the same process and get their root certificate as well. You are also required to update the SSL seed using MFDeploy or FEZ Config any time you update the firmware. void DownloadOverSsl(string url, byte[] certificate) { using (var request = HttpWebRequest.Create(url) as HttpWebRequest) { request.HttpsAuthentCerts = new X509Certificate[] { new X509Certificate(certificate) }; request.KeepAlive = false; using (var response = request.GetResponse()) { using (var stream = response.GetResponseStream()) { var result = string.Empty; var buffer = new byte[4096]; var read = 0; stream.ReadTimeout = 5000; for (var left = response.ContentLength; left > 0; ) { Thread.Sleep(1000); try { read = stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length); } catch { continue; } left -= read; result += new string(Encoding.UTF8.GetChars(buffer, 0, read)); } Debug.Print(result); } } } } If you do not want to use the HTTP classes, you can use a raw socket. After you have called Connect on the desired socket, pass it to the constructor of SslStream found in System.Net.Security. You then have to call AuthenticateAsClient on it. The first parameter is the common name. Often that is the host portion of the URL, such as \"www.ghielectronics.com\", but it is not always. To find the common name of the site, look at the \"Issued To\" field on the certificate details window. The next parameter is null, followed by an X509Certificate array containing the root certificate. The last two parameters need to be SslVerification.CertificateRequired and SslProtocols.Default. Once that call completes, you can read and write to that stream. Calls to Read will not always succeed, especially if called in rapid succession. You should wait a bit between calls. Waits up to 1 second can be expected depending on your exact network characteristics. We recommend testing different lengths and calibrating the wait for your needs."

    "keywords": "Pulse Feedback Introduction The PulseFeedback class can be found in the GHI.Hardware assembly and can be used in three different modes. The first mode is EchoDuration. This mode sends a pulse of a given length and state over the provided pin. It then waits for an echo on the other specified pin and measures how long in microseconds that echo pulse was. The echo and pulse pin can be the same if required. The next mode is DurationUntilEcho. It is very similar to EchoDuration, though instead of sending a pulse and measuring the length of the resulting echo, it measures how long it takes until that echo is received. The below example illustrates sending a pulse of 10us and reading an echo on the same pin where both the pulse and echo are high. A constructor overload is available that allows you to specify a different echo pin and state. using GHI.IO; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; using System.Threading; public class Program { public static void Main() { var pulse = new PulseFeedback(PulseFeedback.Mode.EchoDuration, true, 10, Cpu.Pin.GPIO_NONE); while (true) { Debug.Print(pulse.Read().ToString()); Thread.Sleep(250); } } } Measuring Capacitance The final mode is DrainDuration. This mode is often used in capacitive touch. When calling Read, the pulse line will be held in the specified state for the specified length and then is set to an input. When a resistor and capacitor are connected to this pin and ground, the pin will fall to ground after a short period of time dependent on the capacitance on the pin. The below image shows a sample circuit. Do note that this mode can only be used with a single pin. The exact values of the capacitor and resistor will depend on your setup. Generally a resistor in the megaohm range and a capacitor in the low picofarads in acceptable. Pin Example This image shows an example pin capture for each of the modes. It is not drawn to scale. The area marked by the arrows is the time measured for each mode. Remember that the pulse and echo may be on separate pins. Timeouts A call to Read will block until the expected pin state has occurred or the timeout has expired. In the latter case, -1 will be returned. The ReadTimeout property controls this."

    "title": "PWM",
    "keywords": "PWM PWM is used to control of the ratio of a pin's high and low state, the \"duty cycle.\" This can be done using software or using built-in PWM pins on the processor. PWM pins have the advantage over Software PWM because the toggling is independent of the CPU. Software PWM is performed using the SignalGenerator class. PWM objects are constructed with the period and duration of the pulse. The duration is how long the pin is high or active while the period is the time between one duration and the next. \"Duty Cycle\" is the ratio of the duration and the period -- as a convenience, a scale can be set. The scale is applied to the numbers assigned to the PWM's properties. A pin with duty cycle 0.5 will be high half the time and low the other half. Some common uses of PWM: control the intensity of lights and the speed of motors by changing the duty-cycle. generate audio tones by keeping the duty-cycle at 50% and changing the frequency. positioning of a servo by using a pulse with a specific duration or width. .NET Micro Framework PWM Channels In NETMF, the PWM pins are defined in the \"Cpu.PWMChannel\" enumeration. As the enumeration has a limited number of members, the number of PWM pins may exceed the members. Casting can be used for those extra PWMs. // Using the enumeration PWM MyServo = new PWM(Cpu.PWMChannel.PWM_3, 2175, 175, PWM.ScaleFactor.Microseconds, false); // Lots of PWMs on processor, use a cast to access an extra PWM PWM LED = new PWM((Cpu.PWMChannel)9, 10000, 0.10, false); > [!Tip] > The examples shown below require the Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware.PWM assembly; > [!Warning] > Some or all PWM pins share the same timers internally. This means the changing frequency on one pin will also effect the others. However, the duty cycle can be different on all pins. Users needing to determine which pins share the same timer have two options. Either use trial and error on all PWM pins or check the processor manual. ## Controlling LEDs Brightness This example starts the LED at 0% intensity then slowly steps up to full intensity, after which it reverts to 0% and starts over. ```cs using System.Threading; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { static PWM MyFader = new PWM(Cpu.PWMChannel.PWM_0, 10000, 0.1, false); public static void Main() { double i = 0.0; while (true) { MyFader.DutyCycle = i; /* DutyCycle is not dynamic so make a call to * Start() to refresh the object */ MyFader.Start(); if ((i += 0.1) >= 1.0) { i = 0.0; } Thread.Sleep(10); } } } Musical Tones Music notes have specific frequencies, for example C is about 261Hz. Plugging these numbers into an array and knowing the length of each tone is all that is needed to play some simple music. using System.Threading; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { const int NOTE_C = 261; const int NOTE_D = 294; const int NOTE_E = 330; const int NOTE_F = 349; const int NOTE_G = 392; const int WHOLE_DURATION = 1000; const int EIGHTH = WHOLE_DURATION / 8; const int QUARTER = WHOLE_DURATION / 4; const int QUARTERDOT = WHOLE_DURATION / 3; const int HALF = WHOLE_DURATION / 2; const int WHOLE = WHOLE_DURATION; //make sure the two below arrays match in length. each duration element corresponds to //one note element. static int[] note = { NOTE_E, NOTE_E, NOTE_F, NOTE_G, NOTE_G, NOTE_F, NOTE_E, NOTE_D, NOTE_C, NOTE_C, NOTE_D, NOTE_E, NOTE_E, NOTE_D, NOTE_D, NOTE_E, NOTE_E, NOTE_F, NOTE_G, NOTE_G, NOTE_F, NOTE_E, NOTE_D, NOTE_C, NOTE_C, NOTE_D, NOTE_E, NOTE_D, NOTE_C, NOTE_C}; static int[] duration = { QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTERDOT, EIGHTH, HALF, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTER, QUARTERDOT, EIGHTH, WHOLE}; public static void Main() { PWM MyPWM = new PWM(Cpu.PWMChannel.PWM_3, 261, 0.50, false); while (true) { for (int i = 0; i < note.Length; i++) { MyPWM.Stop(); MyPWM.Frequency = note[i]; MyPWM.Start(); Thread.Sleep(duration[i]); } Thread.Sleep(100); } } } Servos For the servo in this example, if the pulse width is about 1.25ms then the servo is at 0 degrees. Increasing the pulse width to 1.50ms will move the servo to 90 degrees (neutral). A wider pulse of 1.75ms will move the servo to 180 degrees. Servos expect a pulse every 20ms to 30ms. It is important for the high pulse to be between 1.25ms and 1.75ms so that the servo's position is set properly. The code below will move the position of the servo to 180 degrees (using a pulse of 1.75ms). It uses a pause time between pulses of 20ms. So the period is 21.75ms and a duration of 1.75ms. Note the use of \"scale\". using System.Threading; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { public static void Main() { PWM MyServo = new PWM(Cpu.PWMChannel.PWM_3, 2175, 1750, PWM.ScaleFactor.Microseconds, false); while (true) { // 0 degrees. 20ms period and 1.25ms high pulse MyServo.Duration = 1250; MyServo.Period = 20000; MyServo.Start(); Thread.Sleep(1000); // 90 degrees. 20ms period and 1.50ms high pulse MyServo.Duration = 1500; MyServo.Period = 20000; MyServo.Start(); Thread.Sleep(1000); // 180 degrees. 20ms period and 1.75ms high pulse MyServo.Duration = 1750; MyServo.Period = 20000; MyServo.Start(); Thread.Sleep(1000); } } }"

    "title": "Runtime Loadable Procedures",
    "keywords": "Runtime Loadable Procedures Introduction In .NET Micro Framework, C# is complied to an intermediate languages that is interpreted by the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The C# you write is not executed directly by processor. In a typical application, you will not see much difference in speed as many objects used in your application are implemented as native code internally and are not interpreted. When running processor intensive tasks, like cryptography algorithms or even as simple as calculating CRC, however, you will likely notice the interpreter overhead. GHI's Runtime Loadable Procedures (RLP) allow you to write and compile native code that you load onto the device and execute from the interpreted C#. Installing the compiler Since you are writing native code for an ARM device, you cannot easily use Visual Studio. Yagarto provides a helpful toolchain for compiling native code for ARM. Download and then install the following programs in order. Make sure the install paths do not have any spaces in them. Compiling will not function if they do. yagarto-bu-2.23.1_gcc-4.7.2-c-c++_nl-1.20.0_gdb-7.5.1_eabi_20121222.exe yagarto-tools-20121018-setup.exe You can verify the correct installation by running make --version and arm-none-eabi-gcc --version from a command prompt. Getting Started Download and extract the samples found here . The RLP.h file found in the Native directory is a header that defines our extensions and helpers that make it easier to write your native code. You will also see a folder for each supported platform. Within each platform, there are four files. makefile and LinkerScript.lds are basic scripts that we provide to get started with compiling your program. You will not normally need to edit them. Build.bat will actually compile your code for you and produce an elf and map file as output. NativeCode.c is an example file that shows you some basic functions. You can modify it and add your own functions. Every function you write that you want to be called from managed code must have the following signature: int YourFunc(void** args); When you invoke that function from the managed side, any arguments you pass will be found in that void** parameter. If you pass five arguments, then args will be an array of five void pointers. It is your job to then cast each of these pointers to their native equivalent. The following table shows the supported NETMF parameter types and their native equivalent: | C# Parameter | Native Parameter | | byte | unsigned char | | sbyte | char | | short | short | | ushort | unsigned short | | int | int | | uint | unsigned int | | long | long | | ulong | unsigned long | | float | float | | double | double | | bool | unsigned char | | Bitmap | unsigned short[] | Arrays of each of the above parameters (except bitmaps) are also supported. When passing a non-array parameter, it is by value. Any changes to these parameters on the native side are not seen on the managed side. Arrays, however, are passed by reference. Any change to the value of a member of an array is seen on the managed side. Make sure to not read or write past the end of the array. It is up to you to track its length, perhaps through a second parameter you pass. For example, imagine you have passed an integer, a byte array, its length, and a boolean down to the native side. You can retrieve those parameters using the following code: int YourFunc(void** args) { int arg1 = *(int*)(args[0]); //the integer unsigned char* arg2 = (unsigned char*)(args[1]); //the byte array int arg3 = *(int*)(args[2]); //the length of the byte array unsigned char arg4 = *(unsigned char*)(args[3]); //the boolean } When you pass a primitive value, you simple cast the void pointer to a pointer of the corresponding native type and dereference it. When the argument is an array, you again cast the void pointer to a pointer of the corresponding native type but you do not reference it. You can dereference that pointer as if it were an array. Again, make sure to not read beyond its length. Warning Make sure you do not store the pointer to a passed array parameter between function invocations. The array is managed by the CLR and the garbage collector may relocate it between invocations. If you want to pass data outside of the parameters to Invoke for performance reasons, you can allocate a buffer on the native side and return its address to managed code. From there, you can read and write to that buffer using Register and AddressSpace. Compiling Once you have written your code, in the folder that contains makefile, LinkerScript.lds, and NativeCode.c run the file Build.bat. You will see some compiler output and an elf and a map file will appear in the directory. Both files will be called [board name]RLP. The ELF file is the one that you will need to load into RLP from the managed code. To be able to invoke the native function from managed code, you must get the compiled ELF file into a byte array in the managed side. You can save the ELF file as a resource, to an SD card, or to the network and then read or download it. Warning If the native code you execute hangs or crashes, NETMF and the device will become unresponsive. It is recommended that you do not execute any RLP code as soon as the board boots because if it crashes you will have no way to redeploy a program requiring you to completely erase and reflash the board. Invoking Your Function The below code shows you how to load the byte array representing the ELF file into RLP and calling it natively. (It assumes you have added the ELF file as a resource to your C# project.) You pass the name of your native function into the FindFunction function and it will return an object that you can call Invoke() on and pass parameters. We will use the same four parameters as above, an integer, byte array, its length, and a boolean. This code requires the GHI.Hardware assembly. using GHI.Processor; using Microsoft.SPOT; public class Program { public static void Main() { byte[] elfBuffer = Resources.GetBytes(Resources.BinaryResources.ELFFile); //Make sure to load the ELF file you compiled into this array. var elfImage = new RuntimeLoadableProcedures.ElfImage(elfBuffer); var yourFunction = elfImage.FindFunction(\"YourFunc\"); var byteArray = new byte[] { 25, 5, 0 }; int anInteger = 5; var result = yourFunction.Invoke(anInteger, byteArray, byteArray.Length, true); Debug.Print(\"The function returned \" + result.ToString()); //Should be 5 Debug.Print(\"The third element of the byte array is \" + byteArray[2].ToString()); //Should be 30 } } Now imagine we defined the native function like this: int YourFunc(void** args) { int arg1 = *(int*)(args[0]); //the integer unsigned char* arg2 = (unsigned char*)(args[1]); //the byte array int arg3 = *(int*)(args[2]); //the length of the byte array unsigned char arg4 = *(unsigned char*)(args[3]); //the boolean if (arg4 != 0) arg2[2] = arg2[0] + arg2[1]; return arg1; } The first parameter, the integer, is returned from the function. You can access that value as the return value of the Invoke function in the managed side. The above C# example prints out that value. If the fourth parameter, the boolean, is not false (0 is false, otherwise it is true) we will add the first and second elements of the byte array and store the result in the third element. You will see the change to the array in the managed side. Events and Tasks Sometimes you might have a long running function that runs in RLP. Since RLP blocks the managed side, nothing else on the board will run for the duration of the that function call. Using RLP tasks, your native function can register a function to be called at some future point so that you can return to NETMF. As long as this callback function is short lived, the managed side will continue to execute. You can break your work up into smaller chunks that are worked on during each callback invocation. When you are done, you can trigger an event on the managed side. Make sure to re-register the callback so long as there is more work to do. The below example passes the first and only argument passed to RLP into the task and then fires that many events. It schedules itself to fire again in one second until the parameter is zero. RLP_Task task; void TaskCallback(void* arg) { unsigned int* count = (unsigned int*)arg; RLP->PostManagedEvent(*count); if (*count > 0) { *count -= 1; RLP->Task.ScheduleTimeOffset(&task, 1000000); } else { RLP->Task.Abort(&task); } } int StartTask(void** args) { RLP->Task.Initialize(&task, TaskCallback, args[0], RLP_FALSE); RLP->Task.Schedule(&task); return 1; } As before, we create and invoke the RLP function object but we also subscribe to the NativeEvent event and then print out the value received. Every time PostManagedEvent is called from the native side, this event will be fired with the data passed to it. In this example, it should be fired six times, printing out 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and then 0. using GHI.Processor; using Microsoft.SPOT; using System.Threading; public class Program { public static void Main() { byte[] elfBuffer = Resources.GetBytes(Resources.BinaryResources.ELFFile); //Make sure to add an ELF file as a resource RuntimeLoadableProcedures.NativeEvent += RuntimeLoadableProcedures_NativeEvent; var elfImage = new RuntimeLoadableProcedures.ElfImage(elfBuffer); var startTask = elfImage.FindFunction(\"StartTask\"); startTask.Invoke(5); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } private static void RuntimeLoadableProcedures_NativeEvent(object sender, RuntimeLoadableProcedures.NativeEventEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"We've received \" + e.Data.ToString() + \" from the native side.\"); //Should be 5 to 0 } } Bitmaps You can also pass bitmaps to RLP. You will receive an unsigned short array in the argument list. Changes made to that array will be reflected in the bitmap back in C#. As with all arrays, make sure not to save it between invocations or read beyond its end. Its length is equal to bitmap.Width x bitmap.Height. Each entry in the array represents one pixel in RGB 565 format. You can access a pixel using the following code: void SetPixel(unsigned short* bmp, int x, int y, int bitmapWidth, unsigned short color) { bmp[y * bitmapWidth + x] = color; } Multiple Files If you load more than one ELF image at a time, you must be sure that all images after the first occupy a unique location in RAM. The header and linker scripts we provide place the ELF image at a certain default location. You must change that for the second file so that you do not overwrite the first file when you load the second. When compiling, you should see a map file created as one of the outputs. This file tells you exactly how big and where each function is located. You can use it to determine where your second image must start."

    "keywords": "Real Time Clock Introduction Systems typically have a Real Time Clock (RTC) that uses a backup battery (VBAT) and a separate crystal to keep time running even if the system is not powered. Typical crystal value is 32.768Khz. Consult your product's documentation to see if it has a built in RTC. Note: NETMF has time services that you can use to get/set the system time such as DateTime.Now. When power is lost or the system is reset, the time is also reset. Those services do not need RTC. An application can set proper time by reading from the RTC (running from a separate always-on power) or from the internet through a time server. Not having RTC will not limit NETMF's time services beyond resetting the date and time to a preset value. Time measurement is still available. Time via NETMF This example sets the current time to a predefined value that is lost when power is lost. using System; using System.Threading; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { public static void Main() { //Set the time to 07/25/2012 at 11:46:11 DateTime time = new DateTime(2012, 07, 25, 11, 46, 11); // lost after power cycle or reset: Utility.SetLocalTime(time); while (true) { Debug.Print(DateTime.Now.ToString()); Thread.Sleep(100); } } } Using GHI's extension for Real Time Clock To use the RTC hardware, we first need to check if the RTC hardware has the valid time or not. If RTC has a valid time then we can read from the RTC and use that to set the NETMF system time. If time is not valid, then you will need to set the RTC to the correct time. You can verify the validilty of the RTS several ways. One way is to use the built in battery ram (if available) to store some \"magic numbers\" that we check later to determine if the battery ram data is still valid. If they are then most likely the RTC is valid. You can also check the RTC against some known time. For example, if your program was written on 1/1/2014, you can check to see if the current RTC date is before that known date. If it is, then the time is incorrect. using System; using GHI.Processor; using Microsoft.SPOT; public class Program { public static void Main() { DateTime DT; try { DT = RealTimeClock.GetDateTime(); Debug.Print(\"Current Real-time Clock \" + DT.ToString()); } catch // If the time is not good due to powerloss or being a new system an exception will be thrown and a new time will need to be set { Debug.Print(\"The date was bad and caused a bad time\"); DT = new DateTime(2014, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1); // This will set a time for the Real-time Clock clock to 1:01:01 on 1/1/2014 RealTimeClock.SetDateTime(DT); //This will set the hardware Real-time Clock to what is in DT } if (DT.Year < 2011) { Debug.Print(\"Time is not resonable\"); } Debug.Print(\"Current Real-time Clock \" + RealTimeClock.GetDateTime().ToString()); DT = new DateTime(2014, 9, 15, 7, 30, 0); // This will set the clock to 9:30:00 on 9/15/2014 RealTimeClock.SetDateTime(DT); //This will set the hardware Real-time Clock to what is in DT Debug.Print(\"New Real-time Clock \" + RealTimeClock.GetDateTime().ToString()); } }"

If your signal is shorter than that, the call will never return. Make sure to request only what you plan to capture. Alternatively, you can use the ReadTimeout property to signal to the call to return after the number of milliseconds specified by the property regardless of how much data you captured."

    "keywords": "Signal Generator Introduction SignalGenerator is non-blocking digital waveform generator. SignalGenerator works by comparing an internal counter to an array of time values, one by one; when the value of the argument matches the counter, the output pin is changed. The values are in microseconds. SignalGenerator can also be used to generate PWM; unlike the PWM class, SignalGenerator can be used to generate PWM on any available output pins; however, it uses a processor time, the higher the frequency the more processing it uses. SignalGenerator can operate in two modes: non-blocking: runs in the background using system interrupts, and blocking: which does block (while it is running, it does not yield time to other code). This mode has higher accuracy (used, for example, to generate carrier frequencies for infrared signals). Blinking LED This example uses an array of toggle times to turn the LED on and off. The state of the the pin controlled by SignalGenerator will change after waiting for the durations specified in an array. Onces all the elements have been used; SignalGenerator will, optionally, start over at the beginning of the array. using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; using GHI.IO; public class Program { public static void Main() { uint[] time = new uint[] { 500 * 1000, 500 * 1000 }; SignalGenerator LED = new SignalGenerator(Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin1, false); // args: initial value, // array of times, // array start offset, // length of array, // repeat -- if true ==> repeat LED.Set(false, time, 0, 2, true);//start the waveform //... do more code here and the LED will continue to work. //... because the default running mode is non-blocking. } }"

    "title": "SPI",
    "keywords": "SPI SPI uses three, sometimes four, wires for transferring data. The bus on SPI consists of one master and one or more slaves. The master will send clock to the salves along with data and will read back using the same clock. This clock is used to determine how fast the data is moved. If you know electronics, this is a shift register. So, the master will transmit a clock on a SCK (serial clock) pin and will simultaneously transmit the data on MOSI (Master Out Slave In) pin. The slave will read the clock on SCK pin and simultaneously read the data from MOSI pin. So far, this is a one way communication. While data is transmitted in one direction using MOSI another set of data is sent back on MISO (Master In Slave Out) pin. Other data sizes are possible but bytes are most common. NETMF supports 8-bit (byte) and 16-bit (short) data transfers. Because of this master/slave scheme, we can add multiple slaves on the same bus where the master selects which slave it will swap the data with. Note I am using the word swap because you can never send or receive but you always send and receive (swap) data. The master selects one of the slaves using SSEL (Slave Select) pin. This pin can be called CS (Chip Select) as well. In theory, the master can have unlimited slaves but it can only select one of them at any given time. The master will only need 3 wires (SCK, MISO, MOSI) to connect to all slaves on the bus but then it needs a separate SSEL pin for each one of the slaves. Some SPI devices (slaves) can have more than one select pin, like VS1053 MP3 decoder chip that uses one pin for data and one pin for commands but both share the 3 data transfer pins (SCK, MOSI, MISO). SPI needs more wires than other similar buses but it can transfer data very fast. A 50Mhz clock is possible on SPI, that is 50 million bits in one second. Note that NETMF devices are always SPI masters, not slaves. Before creating a SPI object, we would need a SPI configuration object. The configuration object is used to set the states of the SPI pins and some timing parameters. In most cases, you need the clock to be idle low (false) with clocking on rising edge (true) and with zero for select setup and hold time. The only thing you would need to set is the clock frequency. Some devices may accept high frequencies but others do not. Setting the clock to 1000Khz (1Mhz) should be okay for a starter Getting Started This example is sending/receiving 10 bytes of data on SPI channel 1. Note: NETMF start numbering SPI channels (module) from 1, but on processors the channels start from 0 typically. So, using SPI1 in code is actually using SPI0 on the processor. using System.Threading; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { public static void Main() { SPI.Configuration MyConfig = new SPI.Configuration(Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin1, false, 0, 0, false, true, 1000, SPI.SPI_module.SPI1); SPI MySPI = new SPI(MyConfig); byte[] tx_data = new byte[10]; byte[] rx_data = new byte[10]; MySPI.WriteRead(tx_data, rx_data); Thread.Sleep(100); } } Accessing Multiple Devices The SPI object on NETMF is a representation of the \"bus\" and not the \"device\", so you can't construct multiple SPI objects, unless it uses a different SPI bus. To access multiple SPI devices you need to have multiple configurations and then when accessing device \"A\" we need to use configuration \"A\" and when accessing device \"B\" we need to use configuration \"B\". using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware; public class Program { public static void Main() { SPI.Configuration ConfigDeviceA = new SPI.Configuration(Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin1, false, 0, 0, false, true, 1000, SPI.SPI_module.SPI1); SPI.Configuration ConfigDeviceB = new SPI.Configuration(Cpu.Pin.GPIO_Pin4, false, 0, 0, false, true, 1000, SPI.SPI_module.SPI1); SPI MySPI = new SPI(ConfigDeviceA); byte[] tx_data = new byte[10]; byte[] rx_data = new byte[10]; // accessing device A MySPI.Config = ConfigDeviceA; MySPI.WriteRead(tx_data, rx_data); // accessing device B MySPI.Config = ConfigDeviceB; MySPI.WriteRead(tx_data, rx_data); } }"

You must instead use the pre-created application instance available under Application.Current. The below example shows you how to use touch in a Gadgeteer program. Tip In the below example we still use a Bitmap object to draw to the display. Usually in Gadgeteer programs you will want to use the SimpleGraphics interface on a display module. using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Input; using Microsoft.SPOT.Presentation; using Microsoft.SPOT.Presentation.Media; using Microsoft.SPOT.Touch; public partial class Program { private Bitmap lcd; void ProgramStarted() { this.lcd = new Bitmap(SystemMetrics.ScreenWidth, SystemMetrics.ScreenHeight); Touch.Initialize(Application.Current); this.display.WPFWindow.TouchDown += this.MainWindow_TouchDown; this.display.WPFWindow.TouchUp += this.MainWindow_TouchUp; this.display.WPFWindow.TouchMove += this.MainWindow_TouchMove; } private void MainWindow_TouchMove(object sender, TouchEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Touch move at (\" + e.Touches[0].X.ToString() + \", \" + e.Touches[0].Y.ToString() + \")\"); this.lcd.DrawEllipse(Colors.Blue, e.Touches[0].X, e.Touches[0].Y, 5, 5); this.lcd.Flush(); } private void MainWindow_TouchUp(object sender, TouchEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Touch up at (\" + e.Touches[0].X.ToString() + \", \" + e.Touches[0].Y.ToString() + \")\"); } private void MainWindow_TouchDown(object sender, TouchEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Touch down at (\" + e.Touches[0].X.ToString() + \", \" + e.Touches[0].Y.ToString() + \")\"); } } Calibration If your screen does not report touches close to where they actually were, your screen may need to be calibrated. NETMF provides functionality that can do this for you. It will give you a list of coordinates to touch at based on the configured screen size and then you give it the coordinates returned when you touch that spot on the display. It usually asks for five points: the four corners and the center. The below example takes care of all of this calibration for you. It requires the Microsoft.SPOT.Native, Microsoft.SPOT.Graphics, Microsoft.SPOT.TinyCore, and Microsoft.SPOT.Touch assemblies. You begin calibration by touching the screen once. After that, touch where each of the five circles is displayed in turn. After you do that, it will show you the calibration data and show a circle wherever you touch. using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Input; using Microsoft.SPOT.Presentation; using Microsoft.SPOT.Presentation.Media; using Microsoft.SPOT.Touch; public class Program : Application { private Bitmap lcd; private bool started; private bool finished; private int currentCalibrationPoint; private int calibrationPoints; private short[] screenX; private short[] screenY; private short[] uncalibratedX; private short[] uncalibratedY; public static void Main() { new Program().Run(); } public Program() { this.lcd = new Bitmap(SystemMetrics.ScreenWidth, SystemMetrics.ScreenHeight); Touch.Initialize(this); this.MainWindow = new Window(); this.MainWindow.TouchUp += this.OnTouchUp; this.currentCalibrationPoint = 0; this.calibrationPoints = 0; this.started = false; this.finished = false; Touch.ActiveTouchPanel.GetCalibrationPointCount(ref this.calibrationPoints); this.screenX = new short[this.calibrationPoints]; this.screenY = new short[this.calibrationPoints]; this.uncalibratedX = new short[this.calibrationPoints]; this.uncalibratedY = new short[this.calibrationPoints]; for (int i = 0, x = 0, y = 0; i < this.calibrationPoints; i++) { Touch.ActiveTouchPanel.GetCalibrationPoint(i, ref x, ref y); this.screenX[i] = (short)x; this.screenY[i] = (short)y; } Touch.ActiveTouchPanel.StartCalibration(); } private void OnTouchUp(object sender, TouchEventArgs e) { if (this.started && !this.finished) { this.uncalibratedX[this.currentCalibrationPoint] = (short)e.Touches[0].X; this.uncalibratedY[this.currentCalibrationPoint] = (short)e.Touches[0].Y; if (++this.currentCalibrationPoint == this.calibrationPoints) { Touch.ActiveTouchPanel.SetCalibration(this.calibrationPoints, this.screenX, this.screenY, this.uncalibratedX, this.uncalibratedY); this.lcd.Clear(); var str = \"Screen X: [\"; for (int i = 0; i < this.calibrationPoints; i++) str += this.screenX[i].ToString() + (i + 1 != this.calibrationPoints ? \", \" : string.Empty); str += \"]\"; this.lcd.DrawText(str, Resources.GetFont(Resources.FontResources.NinaB), Colors.White, 0, 0); str = \"Screen Y: [\"; for (int i = 0; i < this.calibrationPoints; i++) str += this.screenY[i].ToString() + (i + 1 != this.calibrationPoints ? \", \" : string.Empty); str += \"]\"; this.lcd.DrawText(str, Resources.GetFont(Resources.FontResources.NinaB), Colors.White, 0, 15); str = \"Uncalibrated X: [\"; for (int i = 0; i < this.calibrationPoints; i++) str += this.uncalibratedX[i].ToString() + (i + 1 != this.calibrationPoints ? \", \" : string.Empty); str += \"]\"; this.lcd.DrawText(str, Resources.GetFont(Resources.FontResources.NinaB), Colors.White, 0, 30); str = \"Uncalibrated Y: [\"; for (int i = 0; i < this.calibrationPoints; i++) str += this.uncalibratedY[i].ToString() + (i + 1 != this.calibrationPoints ? \", \" : string.Empty); str += \"]\"; this.lcd.DrawText(str, Resources.GetFont(Resources.FontResources.NinaB), Colors.White, 0, 45); this.lcd.Flush(); this.finished = true; } else { this.DrawPoint(this.screenX[this.currentCalibrationPoint], this.screenY[this.currentCalibrationPoint]); } } else if (!this.started) { this.started = true; this.DrawPoint(this.screenX[0], this.screenY[0]); } else if (this.finished) { this.DrawPoint(e.Touches[0].X, e.Touches[0].Y); } } private void DrawPoint(int x, int y) { this.lcd.Clear(); this.lcd.DrawEllipse(Colors.Red, x, y, 6, 6); this.lcd.Flush(); } } After you calibrate your display, you can save the values in the four short arrays in the above program along with the number of calibration points.

  "software/netmf/tutorials/uart.html": {
    "href": "software/netmf/tutorials/uart.html",
    "title": "UART",
    "keywords": "UART UART transfers data between two pins TXD (transmit) and RXD (receive). Normally, the pins are on different processors. Data is sent from TXD, in a sequence, at a predefined speed. The receiver checks data on RXD. Usually systems want to send and receive as well, so there will be a TXD and RXD on one end with another set on the other end. The connection in between is crossed so TXD on one end goes to RXD on the other end and vice versa. UART Technical Details The \" baud rate\" is number of bits are transmitted per second; standard baud rates are 9600, 119200, 115200 and others. Direct connection between TXD/RXD pins use their high/low voltages for bits (\"TTL level,\" 0V to 3.3V). NETMF supports serial ports (UART) in the same way as the full .NET framework. Serial ports on PC's and on NETMF are called \"COM ports.\" Their names start with COM1 and go up (there is no COM0). Processors usually start with UART0 not UART1 (so, COM1 is UART0... etc.) Software UART Through GHI's SignalGenerator, a system can simulate a UART data. This is beneficial as any GPIO pin can be used to send the UART data. A good example is a serial character display. These typically do not require speed and not updated frequently. If all UARTs are being used, any GPIO can be used to simulate a UART transmission. RS232 Processor pins can be set at 0 for low or at the power level for high, 3.3V for example. This means connecting outputs on a micro to inputs on another is safe. These levels are called TTL. In our case here a TTL UART levels. To overcome distances, the very old standard RS232 defined the low state to be +12V. Sounds like it is backwards but this is how it is! This port is found on many systems and found on many PCs. It has been disappearing from PCs lately but this can be easily added using a USB to serial cable. We can't connect the RS232 levels to TTL levels directly. This is easily solved by adding a small circuitry that converts the RS232 levels to TTL, like the MAX232 chip. In other words, do not connect a PC's serial port to a micro directly. Use a level converter in between. Example using UART The following program sends a counter value 10 times per second. The data is sent at 115200 baud so make sure that the receiving end is setup the same way. This program sends the data on COM1 of your NETMF device. This COM number has nothing to do with COM number on your PC. For example, you may have a USB serial port on your PC that maps to COM8 and so you need to open COM8 on your PC, not COM1. The NETMF program will still use COM1 because it uses UART0 (COM1). The data sent can be shown on a terminal program, like Tera Term. Note how we ended the string with \"\\r\\n\". The \"\\r\" is code to tell the terminal to \"return\" back to the beginning of the line and \"\\n\" is to add \"new\" line. When data is received on UART, it is automatically queued a side so you wouldn't lose any data. Tip Using serial ports require the Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware.SerialPort. If your program uses the enums Parity or StopBits, the Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware assembly is needed. using System.IO.Ports; using System.Text; using System.Threading; public class Program { public static void Main() { SerialPort uart = new SerialPort(\"COM1\", 115200); int counter = 0; uart.Open(); while (true) { // create a string string counter_string = \"Count: \" + counter.ToString() + \"\\r\\n\"; // convert the string to bytes byte[] buffer = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(counter_string); // send the bytes on the serial port uart.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length); // increment the counter; counter++; //wait... Thread.Sleep(100); } } } Receiving Data This example will wait until a byte is received on the port and then print it telling you what was sent from the other end. using System.Threading; using System.IO.Ports; using System.Text; public class Program { public static void Main() { SerialPort uart = new SerialPort(\"COM1\", 115200); int read_count = 0; byte[] rx_byte = new byte[1]; uart.Open(); while (true) { // read one byte read_count = uart.Read(rx_byte, 0, 1); if (read_count > 0)// do we have data? { // create a string string counter_string = \"You typed: \" + rx_byte[0].ToString() + \"\\r\\n\"; // convert the string to bytes byte[] buffer = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(counter_string); // send the bytes on the serial port uart.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length); //wait... Thread.Sleep(10); } } } } Sending and Receiving This example is a loop-back. Connect a wire from TX to RX on your board and it will send data and make sure it is receiving it correctly. using System.IO.Ports; using System.Text; using System.Threading; using Microsoft.SPOT; public class Program { public static void Main() { SerialPort uart = new SerialPort(\"COM1\", 115200); int read_count = 0; byte[] tx_data; byte[] rx_data = new byte[10]; tx_data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"FEZ\"); uart.ReadTimeout = 0; uart.Open(); while (true) { // flush all data uart.Flush(); // send some data uart.Write(tx_data, 0, tx_data.Length); // wait to make sure data is transmitted Thread.Sleep(100); // read the data read_count = uart.Read(rx_data, 0, rx_data.Length); if (read_count != 3) { // we sent 3 so we should have 3 back Debug.Print(\"Wrong size: \" + read_count.ToString()); } else { // the count is correct so check the values // I am doing this the easy way so the code is more clear if (tx_data[0] == rx_data[0]) { if (tx_data[1] == rx_data[1]) { if (tx_data[2] == rx_data[2]) { Debug.Print(\"Perfect data!\"); } } } } Thread.Sleep(100); } } } Tip For .NET Gadgeteer examples, see the Device to PC communications document."

    "title": "USB Client",
    "keywords": "USB Client By default, all of GHI's NETMF devices use USB for deploying and debugging. You may optionally use the USB client (not the host) for something other than debugging. This is actually supported by NETMF and GHI Electronics adds more functionality making it even easier to use. Say you are making a device that that reads temperature and humidity and logs all of this data on an SD card. This device can be configured to set the time or give file names and you want this configuration to happen over USB, perhaps in the field. So when your device plugs into a USB port, you want it to show as a virtual serial port. This way, anyone can open a terminal software (like TeraTerm) to connect to your device and configure it. Using the USB client, there is no need to add the extra cost of additional RS232 serial ports or USB<->serial chipsets. The built-in USB client port can be configured to act as a CDC device, a virtual COM port. However, you still need to connect the PC to your device for debugging and deploying applications. Since the USB client port is used by your end application, you need to debug and deploy using a serial connection. You only need the serial interface in the development and deployment stage. Setting Up Debugging and deploying serially is specific to each device so you may want to consult your device's manual or Developers' Guide. Once the device is configured for the serial interface, remember to select the proper transport in Visual Studio. Tip The examples shown below require the Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware.Usb and GHI.Usb assemblies. Mouse The following example tells your device to act as a mouse and send random commands to your computer. You could use this to prank others and send their computer fake mouse commands or to have a second mouse for your own computer. using System; using System.Threading; using GHI.Usb; using GHI.Usb.Client; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware.UsbClient; public class Program { public static void Main() { // Start Mouse Mouse mouse = new Mouse(); Controller.ActiveDevice = mouse; // Move pointer in a swirl const int ANGLE_STEP_SIZE = 15; const int MIN_CIRCLE_DIAMETER = 50; const int MAX_CIRCLE_DIAMETER = 200; const int CIRCLE_DIAMETER_STEP_SIZE = 1; int diameter = MIN_CIRCLE_DIAMETER; int diameterIncrease = CIRCLE_DIAMETER_STEP_SIZE; int angle = 0; int factor; Random rnd = new Random(); int i = 0; while (true) { // we want to do it every sometime randomly i = rnd.Next(5000) + 5000;//between 5 and 10 seconds Debug.Print(\"Delaying for \" + i + \" ms\"); Thread.Sleep(i); i = rnd.Next(200) + 100;//do it for a short time Debug.Print(\"Looping \" + i + \" times!\"); while (i-- > 0) { // Check if connected to PC if (Controller.State == UsbController.PortState.Running) { // Note Mouse X, Y are reported as change in position // (relative position, not absolute) factor = diameter * ANGLE_STEP_SIZE * (int)System.Math.PI / 180 / 2; int dx = (-1 * factor * (int)Microsoft.SPOT.Math.Sin(angle) / 1000); int dy = (factor * (int)Microsoft.SPOT.Math.Cos(angle) / 1000); angle += ANGLE_STEP_SIZE; diameter += diameterIncrease; if (diameter >= MAX_CIRCLE_DIAMETER || diameter <= MIN_CIRCLE_DIAMETER ) diameterIncrease *= -1; // report mouse position mouse.SendRawData(dx, dy, 0,Buttons.None); } Thread.Sleep(10); } } } } Keyboard Emulating a keyboard is as very similar to emulating a mouse. The following example will create a USB Keyboard and send \"Hello world!\" to a computer every second. using System.Threading; using GHI.Usb; using GHI.Usb.Client; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware.UsbClient; public class Program { public static void Main() { // Start keyboard Keyboard kb = new Keyboard(); Controller.ActiveDevice = kb; Debug.Print(\"Waiting to connect to PC...\"); // Send \"Hello world!\" every second while (true) { // Check if connected to PC if ( Controller.State == UsbController.PortState.Running) { // We need shift down for capital \"H\" kb.Press(Key.LeftShift); kb.Stroke(Key.H); kb.Release(Key.LeftShift); // Now \"ello world\" kb.Stroke(Key.E); kb.Stroke(Key.L); kb.Stroke(Key.L); kb.Stroke(Key.O); kb.Stroke(Key.Space); kb.Stroke(Key.W); kb.Stroke(Key.O); kb.Stroke(Key.R); kb.Stroke(Key.L); kb.Stroke(Key.D); // The \"!\" kb.Press(Key.LeftShift); kb.Stroke(Key.D1); kb.Release(Key.LeftShift); // Send an enter key kb.Stroke(Key.Enter); } Thread.Sleep(1000); } } } CDC - Virtual Serial Port Serial ports are the most common interface, especially in the embedded system world. It is an ideal solution for devices to transfer data between computers and embedded devices NETMF products. To combine the popularity and usefulness of USB with the ease of serial, we have virtual USB devices. To Windows' applications or devices, a virtual serial port works just like a serial port but it is actually a USB port. To use CDC, you need the USB Drivers that come with the GHI Electronics NETMF and Gadgeteer SDK (2016 R1 and later). This will only work if you use the default constructor of the Cdc class. If you do not and you provide different Vendor and Product Ids, this driver will not work and you will need to create your own. You can use the one we provide in the SDK as a model, though it will not be signed. Note: CDC drivers usually handle one transaction in every frame. The max EP size on USB is 64 bytes and there 1000 frames per second on full-speed USB. This means that the maximum transfer rate in ideal conditions for CDC is 64KB/sec. The buffer size is limited so you must be make sure to read all data quickly because there is no overflow event. The following example will create a USB CDC and send \"Hello world!\" to computer every second. using System.Threading; using GHI.Usb; using GHI.Usb.Client; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware.UsbClient; public class Program { public static void Main() { // Start Cdc Cdc vsp = new Cdc(); Controller.ActiveDevice = vsp; // Send \"Hello world!\" to PC every second. (Append a new line too) byte[] bytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"Hello world!\\r\\n\"); while (true) { // Check if connected to PC if (Controller.State != UsbController.PortState.Running) { Debug.Print(\"Waiting to connect to PC...\"); } else { vsp.Stream.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length); } Thread.Sleep(1000); } } } Mass Storage GHI's USB client supports Mass Storage Class (MSC). This allows access to connected media right from USB. For example, a data logger application that needs to save data to an SD card or USB memory. When the user is done collecting data, they can plug the USB data logger into the PC and now the PC can detect the device as a mass storage device. The user can then transfer the files using standard operating system controls. It may be helpful to think of the device as a memory card reader. We can even enhance our logger where the USB client interface can be CDC to configure the device and later dynamically switch to MSC to transfer files. Once very common question on GHI Electronics support is \"Why can't I access the media from my application while the media is also accessed externally (from windows)?\" Due to caching of file system data and/or the possibility of a write from one interface while the other is doing a read and/or a write, data on the media and/or data used by the interface will likely (and quickly) be corrupted. Note: you can easily switch back and forth between internal file system and USB MSC. This example code assumes an SD card is always plugged in. It enables MSC showing the device as a card reader. This code assumes that the USB port is NOT being used for debugging. In addition to the assemblies mentioned above in the Note, the following code requires the GHI.Hardware assembly. using System; using System.Threading; using GHI.Usb.Client; using GHI.Usb; using GHI.IO.Storage; public class Program { public static void Main() { // Start MS MassStorage ms = new MassStorage(); Controller.ActiveDevice = ms; // Assume SD card is connected SDCard sd; try { sd = new SDCard(); } catch { throw new Exception(\"SD card not detected\"); } ms.AttachLogicalUnit(sd,0, \" \", \" \"); // enable host access ms.EnableLogicalUnit(0); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } } HID and Custom Devices Windows and other operating systems have built in drivers for USB HID (Human Interface Devices). These drivers are ideal as they provide a simple way to transfer data between a computer and a device. HID's are usually mice and keyboards but they can also be simple data transfer devices. Although examples in codeshare may need changes for differences in SDK releases, this project provides a good example: http://www.ghielectronics.com/community/codeshare/entry/420 The GHI Electronics USB Client allows you to control the USB client in anyway you like. This feature requires advanced knowledge of USB. If you do not know what an EndPoint or a Pipe is then do not attempt to create custom devices. It is very important to have the device configured correctly the first time it is plugged into Windows since Windows stores a lot of information in its registry. If you change the configuration of your device after you had it plugged into Windows previously, Windows may not see the changes since it will be using the old configuration from its registry. Do not use USB Client Custom Devices unless you really have good reason to use them and you are knowledgeable in USB and Windows drivers."

    "title": "USB Host",
    "keywords": "USB Host There is usually a lot of confusion between USB host and USB client. USB host is the system that connects to multiple USB clients. For example, the PC is a USB host and it can connect to multiple USB clients like mice, keyboards, and mass storage devices. Implementing a USB client is rather simple but implementing a host is far more complicated. USB host is an exclusive feature from GHI Electronics. With this feature, you can connect almost any USB device to GHI's NETMF products. This feature opens new possibilities for embedded systems. Your product can now connect to a standard USB keyboard and can also access files on a USB thumb drive. USB is a hot pluggable system which means any device can be connected or disconnected at any time. Events are generated when devices are connected or disconnected. The program that you write should subscribe to these events and handle them accordingly. With USB hub support, devices can be connected directly to the USB host port or the user may connect multiple USB devices through a USB hub. Getting Started When working with USB host, you interact with the Controller. You subscribe to the connected event for various devices and then start the controller. When a device connected, you receive an object representing that device as the event arguments. You can subscribe to the Disconnect event on that device to do any clean up you might need. The below code requires the GHI.Usb and GHI.Hardware assemblies and shows you briefly how to handle device connections and disconnections. using GHI.Usb.Host; using Microsoft.SPOT; using System.Threading; public class Program { public static void Main() { Controller.DeviceConnectFailed += Controller_DeviceConnectFailed; Controller.KeyboardConnected += Controller_KeyboardConnected; Controller.Start(); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } private static void Controller_DeviceConnectFailed(object sender, EventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Failed.\"); } private static void Controller_KeyboardConnected(object sender, Keyboard keyboard) { Debug.Print(\"Keyboard connected.\"); keyboard.Disconnected += keyboard_Disconnected; } private static void keyboard_Disconnected(BaseDevice sender, EventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Keyboard disconnected.\"); } } Mice, keyboards, and joysticks Once you receive a connect event and the associated object for a mouse, keyboard, or joystick, you can subscribe to various events on those objects to receive data from the device. The below code simply prints out when a button or key is pressed. using GHI.Usb.Host; using Microsoft.SPOT; using System.Threading; public class Program { public static void Main() { Controller.KeyboardConnected += Controller_KeyboardConnected; Controller.MouseConnected += Controller_MouseConnected; Controller.JoystickConnected += Controller_JoystickConnected; Controller.Start(); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } private static void Controller_KeyboardConnected(object sender, Keyboard keyboard) { Debug.Print(\"Keyboard connected.\"); keyboard.KeyUp += keyboard_KeyUp; keyboard.KeyDown += keyboard_KeyDown; } private static void Controller_MouseConnected(object sender, Mouse mouse) { Debug.Print(\"Mouse connected.\"); mouse.ButtonChanged += mouse_ButtonChanged; mouse.CursorMoved += mouse_CursorMoved; mouse.WheelMoved += mouse_WheelMoved; } private static void Controller_JoystickConnected(object sender, Joystick joystick) { Debug.Print(\"Joystick connected.\"); joystick.ButtonChanged += joystick_ButtonChanged; joystick.CursorMoved += joystick_CursorMoved; joystick.HatSwitchPressed += joystick_HatSwitchPressed; } private static void keyboard_KeyUp(Keyboard sender, Keyboard.KeyboardEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Up: \" + e.Which.ToString()); } private static void keyboard_KeyDown(Keyboard sender, Keyboard.KeyboardEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Down: \" + e.Which.ToString()); } private static void mouse_ButtonChanged(Mouse sender, Mouse.ButtonChangedEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(e.State.ToString() + \" \" + e.Which); } private static void mouse_CursorMoved(Mouse sender, Mouse.CursorMovedEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(e.Delta.ToString() + \" \" + e.NewPosition.ToString()); } private static void mouse_WheelMoved(Mouse sender, Mouse.WheelMovedEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(e.Delta.ToString() + \" \" + e.NewPosition.ToString()); } private static void joystick_ButtonChanged(Joystick sender, Joystick.ButtonChangedEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(e.State.ToString() + \" \" + e.Which); } private static void joystick_CursorMoved(Joystick sender, Joystick.CursorMovedEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(e.Delta.ToString() + \" \" + e.NewPosition.ToString() + \" \" + e.Which.ToString()); } private static void joystick_HatSwitchPressed(Joystick sender, Joystick.HatSwitchPressedEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(e.Direction.ToString()); } } Serial Serial (UART) communication is a very common interface. There are many companies that create chips that convert USB to serial. GHI Electronics currently supports chipsets from FTDI. Their FT232 is known to work, though others may as well. USB chipsets are made to be somewhat customized. A company can use an FTDI chip to make their product run on USB and they will change the strings in USB descriptors so that when you plug in their device to a PC you will see the company name and not FTDI. They can also change the USB VID/PID, vendor ID and product ID. Many of the interface products on the market use the FTDI chipset. A few other USB-Serial manufacturers, like Prolific, are included, but they are deprecated and not supported by us. The below example simply echoes any data received back out to the sender and prints it to the debug output. using GHI.Usb.Host; using Microsoft.SPOT; using System.Threading; public class Program { public static void Main() { Controller.UsbSerialConnected += Controller_UsbSerialConnected; Controller.Start(); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } private static void Controller_UsbSerialConnected(object sender, UsbSerial usbSerial) { Debug.Print(\"UsbSerial connected.\"); usbSerial.DataReceived += usbSerial_DataReceived; } private static void usbSerial_DataReceived(UsbSerial sender, UsbSerial.DataReceivedEventArgs e) { for (int i = 0; i < e.Data.Length; i++) Debug.Print(e.Data[i].ToString()); sender.Write(e.Data); } } Mass Storage When you connect a mass storage device, it can be accessed through the regular NETMF filesystem functions with the device root \"USB\". Once you mount the device, you need to wait for NETMF to fire the RemovableMedia.Insert event before you try accessing the filesystem. The below code simply opens or creates a file on the drive, writes \"Hello, World!\" to it, and then unmounts the device. It requires the Microsoft.SPOT.IO and System.IO assembly. using GHI.Usb.Host; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.IO; using System.IO; using System.Text; using System.Threading; public class Program { private static AutoResetEvent evt = new AutoResetEvent(false); public static void Main() { Controller.MassStorageConnected += Controller_MassStorageConnected; Controller.Start(); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } private static void Controller_MassStorageConnected(object sender, MassStorage massStorage) { RemovableMedia.Insert += RemovableMedia_Insert; massStorage.Mount(); evt.WaitOne(); using (var fs = new FileStream(\"\\\\USB\\\\Hello.txt\", FileMode.OpenOrCreate)) fs.Write(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"Hello, World!\"), 0, 13); massStorage.Unmount(); } private static void RemovableMedia_Insert(object sender, MediaEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Inserted.\"); evt.Set(); } } Warning Under current versions of NETMF, the Flush method of FileStream will eventually write the buffers; unfortunately, there is a delay (sometimes up to a minute) from when Flush is called to when the data is actually flushed. See Files and Folders for more details. Webcams You can also connect a webcam and stream images from it. Webcams only support certain image formats and sizes so you need to query the formats supported and tell the camera to stream images using that format. We support cameras that support the YUV2 color format. The below code requires the Microsoft.SPOT.Graphics and Microsoft.SPOT.TinyCore assemblies. It looks for a format that has a size of 320x240 and starts to stream it. When a new image is available an event is raised and we draw the received image to the bitmap that represents our screen and then flush it. Make sure you have a display properly configured. using GHI.Usb.Host; using Microsoft.SPOT; using Microsoft.SPOT.Presentation; using System.Threading; public class Program { private static Bitmap lcd = new Bitmap(SystemMetrics.ScreenWidth, SystemMetrics.ScreenHeight); public static void Main() { Controller.WebcamConnected += Controller_WebcamConnected; Controller.Start(); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } private static void Controller_WebcamConnected(object sender, Webcam webcam) { webcam.ImageAvailable += webcam_ImageAvailable; foreach (Webcam.ImageFormat i in webcam.SupportedFormats) { if (i.Width == 320 && i.Height == 240) { webcam.StartStreaming(i); break; } } } private static void webcam_ImageAvailable(Webcam sender, EventArgs e) { sender.GetImage(lcd); lcd.Flush(); } } Unknown Devices If your device is not recognized by our libraries, the UnknownDeviceConnected event will be triggered. This event will give you the USB parameters of the device that you can use to \"force\" the creation of a specific type. This method is not guaranteed to work with every unknown device, however. The below code illustrates how to do this with a usb to serial device. using GHI.Usb.Host; using Microsoft.SPOT; using System.Threading; public class Program { private static UsbSerial serial; public static void Main() { Controller.UnknownDeviceConnected += Controller_UnknownDeviceConnected; Controller.Start(); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } private static void Controller_UnknownDeviceConnected(object sender, Controller.UnknownDeviceConnectedEventArgs e) { Debug.Print(\"Unknown device connected.\"); serial = new UsbSerial(e.Id, e.InterfaceIndex, e.VendorId, e.ProductId, e.PortNumber, BaseDevice.DeviceType.SerialProlific); serial.DataReceived += serial_DataReceived; } private static void serial_DataReceived(UsbSerial sender, UsbSerial.DataReceivedEventArgs e) { for (int i = 0; i < e.Data.Length; i++) Debug.Print(e.Data[i].ToString()); sender.Write(e.Data); } }"

  "software/netmf/tutorials/watchdog.html": {
    "href": "software/netmf/tutorials/watchdog.html",
    "title": "Watchdog",
    "keywords": "Watchdog Introduction In the embedded system world, devices are usually always running and with no user interaction. So if something went wrong, it would be very beneficial if we have an automatic reset button. Watchdog is your reset button! Assume you are making a smart vending machine that reports its inventory over the network. If your code raises an exception that wasn't handled properly then your program will end. Program ended means the vending machine will no longer work. Someone will have to drive to the vending machine to reset it! The alternative is to use the watchdog. When watchdog is enabled, it is given a timeout where it will reset the system if the time reached without resetting the timeout. This is like saying \"reset the system in 5 seconds\" then the program goes on to do something. The program needs to come back and reset the time and say \"reset in 5 seconds\". If the program keeps doing this, the system will never reset. But if the program got stuck somewhere, the 5 seconds will end causing the system to reset. Tip GHI Electronics does not use the NETMF's built in services for watchdog, but uses its own. Use the GHI.Hardware assembly when using watchdog. Warning Do NOT set the Watchdog reset time too short during the debug phase. If it is shorter than the time taken to deploy your code then your device will reboot and the new code never gets loaded. The only way to get out of the problem is to erase the device and reflash the firmware. We advice not to use watchdog during development and debugging. Max Timeouts The following lists shows the max timeout value for watchdog on our various devices in milliseconds. Do note that for G120 and EMX, there is roughly a 30% margin of error around the max value where the device may still reset. G400: 15,995 G120: 134,217 EMX: 4,294,967 Cerberus: 32768 Five Second Watchdog This example shows how to set the watchdog to 5 seconds timeout and create a thread to clear the watchdog every 3 seconds. Should anything go wrong and the thread that clears the watchdog isn't able the run due to another thread using all of the available resources, the device will reset in 5 seconds. Tip Once you enable the Watchdog, it cannot be disabled. So you have to keep resetting the timeout. This is done to assure that no system corruption will disable watchdog accidentally. using System; using System.Threading; using GHI.Processor; public class Program { public static void Main() { // Timeout 5 seconds int timeout = 1000 * 5; // Enable Watchdog Watchdog.Enable(timeout); // Start a time counter reset thread WDTCounterReset = new Thread(WDTCounterResetLoop); WDTCounterReset.Start(); // .... // your program starts here // If we exit the program, // the thread will stop working and the system will reset! Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } static Thread WDTCounterReset; static void WDTCounterResetLoop() { while (true) { // reset time counter every 3 seconds Thread.Sleep(3000); Watchdog.ResetCounter(); } } } You may be thinking, if the software locked up then how would the code that handles watchdog ever run? It works because the watchdog is supported in hardware not software. This means that the counter and the reset mechanism are done inside the processor, without the need for any software. Detecting Watchdog In some cases, you need to know if the system did reset because of a watchdog to log this info or run some recovery procedures. This is how it works using System; using System.Threading; using Microsoft.SPOT; using GHI.Processor; public class Program { public static void Main() { // Normally, you can read this flag ***ONLY ONCE*** on power up if (Watchdog.LastResetCause == Watchdog.ResetCause.Watchdog) { Debug.Print(\"Watchdog did Reset\"); } else { Debug.Print(\"Reset switch or system power\"); } } }"

    "title": "XML",
    "keywords": "XML Introduction Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a standard for containing data. When you want to transfer some info between two devices, you can set some rules on how the data is to be packed and sent from device A. On the other side, device B receives the data and knows how to unpack it. Before XML, this created some difficulties. What if you were sending the data to a system implemented by a different designer? You would have to explain how you packed your data so the other designer can unpack it. With XML, the design is transmitted with the data. XML is extensively used. For example, when a website's shopping cart wants to know the shipping cost on a certain package, it will pack the shipment details in XML format and then send to FedEx. The FedEx website will read the info and send the cost info back in XML format as well. The usefulness of XML can also be utilized in other ways. Let's say you are designing a data logger. Let's also assume the end users will need to configure the data logger to fit their needs. When a user configures the device, you need to store the info internally somehow. You can save the data with your own format which requires extra coding and debugging, or better just use XML. All GHI Electronics NETMF devices have a built-in XML reader and writer (packer and un-packer ). Here is an example XML file that will help in our data logger design. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <NETMF_DataLogger> <FileName>Data</FileName> <FileExt>txt</FileExt> <SampleFreq>10</SampleFreq> </NETMF_DataLogger> This XML example includes a root element and three child elements. XML is very flexible, for instance all info in the example could have been defined as root elements. The root element \"NETMF_DataLogger\" contains three pieces of info that are important for our logger. It contains the file name, the file extension and a frequency of our saved data. With this example, the logger will create a file called Data.txt and then will log data into that file 10 times every second. Spaces and layout do not mean anything to XML, we (humans) need them to make things easier to read. The previous example can be stored without the spaces and layout like this. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?><NETMF_DataLogger><FileName>Data</FileName> <FileExt>txt</FileExt><SampleFreq>10</SampleFreq></NETMF_DataLogger> See why spaces are important to us human being! You can also add comments inside XML files, comments do not mean anything to XML but can help in manual reading of the files <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <!--This is just a comment--> <NETMF_DataLogger> <FileName>Data</FileName> <FileExt>txt</FileExt> <SampleFreq>10</SampleFreq> </NETMF_DataLogger> Finally, XML support attributes. An attribute is an extra info given to an element. Alternatively, you can add another element to describe the extra information. The choice is yours. Attributes are not explained in this document; there are many excellent tutorials and examples on the internet. GHI Electronics' NETMF devices support reading and writing XML format. Reading and writing XML files work over streams which means any stream you already have or implement can work with XML. For example, we will use the built-in MemoryStream and FileStream. The examples shown below require the following assemblies: System.IO, System.Xml, MFDpwsExtensions. XML in Memory This code shows how to make an XML document in memory, it implements the XML presented above. using System.IO; using System.Xml; using System.Ext.Xml; using Microsoft.SPOT; public class Program { public static void Main() { MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(); XmlWriter xmlwrite = XmlWriter.Create(ms); xmlwrite.WriteProcessingInstruction(\"xml\", \"version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"\"); xmlwrite.WriteComment(\"This is just a comment\"); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"NETMF_DataLogger\");//root element xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"FileName\");//child element xmlwrite.WriteString(\"Data\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement(); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"FileExt\"); xmlwrite.WriteString(\"txt\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement(); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"SampleFeq\"); xmlwrite.WriteString(\"10\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement(); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement();//end the root element xmlwrite.Flush(); xmlwrite.Close(); //////// display the XML data /////////// byte[] byteArray = ms.ToArray(); char[] cc = System.Text.UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetChars(byteArray); string str = new string(cc); Debug.Print(str); } } When you try to add an assembly you will notice that there are two assemblies for XML, the \"System.Xml\" and \"System.Xml.Legacy\". Do not use the \"legacy\" driver, it is there for older NETMF devices with systems that did not have built-in support for XML. If the \"Unsupported Exception\" is raised on an older device, replace the System.Xml assembly with System.Xml.Legacy Readable Output When running the example above, we will see the output XML data at the end. The data is correct but it is not formatted to be \"human\" friendly. Note that we are reading and writing XML files on a very small system so the less info (spaces/formatting) the better it is. So it is actually better not to have any extra spaces or formatting but for the sake of making things look pretty, we will add new lines as follows using System.IO; using System.Xml; using System.Ext.Xml; using Microsoft.SPOT; public class Program { public static void Main() { MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(); XmlWriter xmlwrite = XmlWriter.Create(ms); xmlwrite.WriteProcessingInstruction(\"xml\", \"version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"\"); xmlwrite.WriteComment(\"This is just a comment\"); xmlwrite.WriteRaw(\"\\r\\n\"); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"NETMF_DataLogger\");//root element xmlwrite.WriteString(\"\\r\\n\\t\"); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"FileName\");//child element xmlwrite.WriteString(\"Data\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement(); xmlwrite.WriteRaw(\"\\r\\n\\t\"); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"FileExt\"); xmlwrite.WriteString(\"txt\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement(); xmlwrite.WriteRaw(\"\\r\\n\\t\"); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"SampleFeq\"); xmlwrite.WriteString(\"10\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement(); xmlwrite.WriteRaw(\"\\r\\n\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement();//end the root element xmlwrite.Flush(); xmlwrite.Close(); //////// display the XML data /////////// byte[] byteArray = ms.ToArray(); char[] cc = System.Text.UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetChars(byteArray); string str = new string(cc); Debug.Print(str); } } Reading and Parsing Creating XML files is actually easier than parsing (reading) them. There are many ways to read the XML file but basically you can just go through the file and read one piece at the time till you reach the end. This code example creates an XML data and it reads it back. using System.IO; using System.Xml; using System.Ext.Xml; using Microsoft.SPOT; public class Program { public static void Main() { MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(); XmlWriter xmlwrite = XmlWriter.Create(ms); xmlwrite.WriteProcessingInstruction(\"xml\", \"version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"\"); xmlwrite.WriteComment(\"This is just a comment\"); xmlwrite.WriteRaw(\"\\r\\n\"); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"NETMF_DataLogger\");//root element xmlwrite.WriteString(\"\\r\\n\\t\"); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"FileName\");//child element xmlwrite.WriteString(\"Data\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement(); xmlwrite.WriteRaw(\"\\r\\n\\t\"); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"FileExt\"); xmlwrite.WriteString(\"txt\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement(); xmlwrite.WriteRaw(\"\\r\\n\\t\"); xmlwrite.WriteStartElement(\"SampleFeq\"); xmlwrite.WriteString(\"10\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement(); xmlwrite.WriteRaw(\"\\r\\n\"); xmlwrite.WriteEndElement();//end the root element xmlwrite.Flush(); xmlwrite.Close(); //////// display the XML data /////////// byte[] byteArray = ms.ToArray(); char[] cc = System.Text.UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetChars(byteArray); string str = new string(cc); Debug.Print(str); ///////////read xml MemoryStream rms = new MemoryStream(byteArray); XmlReaderSettings ss = new XmlReaderSettings(); ss.IgnoreWhitespace = true; ss.IgnoreComments = false; //XmlException.XmlExceptionErrorCode. XmlReader xmlr = XmlReader.Create(rms,ss); while (!xmlr.EOF) { xmlr.Read(); switch (xmlr.NodeType) { case XmlNodeType.Element: Debug.Print(\"element: \" + xmlr.Name); break; case XmlNodeType.Text: Debug.Print(\"text: \" + xmlr.Value); break; case XmlNodeType.XmlDeclaration: Debug.Print(\"decl: \" + xmlr.Name + \", \" + xmlr.Value); break; case XmlNodeType.Comment: Debug.Print(\"comment \" +xmlr.Value); break; case XmlNodeType.EndElement: Debug.Print(\"end element\"); break; case XmlNodeType.Whitespace: Debug.Print(\"white space\"); break; case XmlNodeType.None: Debug.Print(\"none\"); break; default: Debug.Print(xmlr.NodeType.ToString()); break; } } } }"

Tip Needed NuGet: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Drivers.Azure.SAS Basic Graphics BasicGraphics driver is a simpler alternative that runs on all devices, including small devices without native display support. It contains many useful methods for adding simple graphics,including: SetPixel , DrawLine , DrawRectangle , DrawCircle , DrawString , and DrawCharacter . It also includes support for a micro 5px font through DrawTinyCharacter and DrawTinyString . There are 2 differences between DrawCharacter and DrawTinyCharacter , beside the font size! DrawCharacter can accept scaling to enlarge the font, DrawTinyCharacter does not. Also, DrawCharacter will only set pixels and does not clear blanks. DrawTinyCharacter has the same behavior by default but it has a clear option to set the blanks to 0 (black). There are two ways to use BasicGraphics, the first one is agnostic of what display is being used and simply works by calling SetPixel method that must be overridden by the user. The user has 2 options, either send the pixel directly to the display or buffer the pixels in a \"Video RAM\" working buffer and then flush to the screen when desired. Setting the pixels directly on the screen requires zero memory but it is extremely slow. In the second way, which is the easier way, BasicGraphics will handle allocating the needed video buffer and handles the SetPixel. It already has 2 pixel options, 16BPP 5:6:5 and 1BPP. Tip Needed NuGet: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Drivers.BasicGraphics An example of the first options, that overrides the SetPixel and Clear methods.

    "keywords": "DUE - API The DUE API is designed to give full access of the ScriptEngine in a simple user-friendly way. Tip We will assume GpioExtension sample from Extensions is being used. Run This method will execute a script. var script = new ScriptEngine(typeof(GpioExtension)); script.Run(@\" var led = DigitalPin(4*16+11)//PE11 func OnOff() writePin(led, On) Delay(100) writePin(led, Off) Delay(100) end \"); Run only returns when it has completed running the script. If the script has an infinite loop then Run will never return. A good option would be to spin a thread for Run . The rest of the system will continue to run normally and the thread can be terminated to abort Run is desired. Invoke A function that is found in a script can be executed from C# directly using script.Invoke(\"OnOff\") . Arguments are passed to Invoke with a returned result, sum = Invoke(\"Add\", a, b) . GetFunction A faster way to invoke a function will be by reference var OnOffPointer = script.GetFunction(\"OnOff\"); script.Invoke(OnOffPointer); GetVariable Returns the value of a specific variable x = script.GetVariable(\"x\") The return value is an object. In the case of returned variable being an array in DUE, ArrayList is returned. SetVariable Sets a variable that lives in a DUE script from C# script.SetVariable(\"x\",123) . SetConsole Redirects the Console Statements. For example, the output can be forwarded to a display. class MyConsole : IConsole { private int row = 0; private const int charHeight = 9; // I2C Display static I2cController i2c = I2cController.FromName(SC13048.I2cBus.I2c1); static SSD1306Controller ssd1306 = new SSD1306Controller(i2c.GetDevice(new I2cConnectionSettings(0x3d))); // Basic Graphics static BasicGraphics basicGfx = new BasicGraphics(128, 64, ColorFormat.OneBpp); public void Cls() { basicGfx.Clear(); this.row = 0; } public void Locate(int row, int col) { }// deprecated! public void Print(string s) { if (row >= (basicGfx.Height / charHeight)) { Cls(); row = 0; } basicGfx.DrawString(s, BasicGraphics.ColorFromRgb(0xff, 0xff, 0xff), 0, row * charHeight); ssd1306.DrawBufferNative(basicGfx.Buffer); row++; } } The IConsole interface is then passed to the engine. var script = new ScriptEngine(); var console = new MyConsole(); script.SetConsole(console); script.Run(@\" cls print('Hello World!') cls // will clear the previous prints print('Hello World!') print print 'TinyCLR' print \"\"with DUE\"\" print 'is the best!' \"); GetGlobalVariables Returns an array of Variable objects for all the global variables. Variable has the name, value and a flag indicting if it is a constant or not. public class Variable { public string Name { get; private set; } public object Value { get; private set; } public bool IsConstant { get; private set; } } script.Run(@\" const PI = 3.14159265359 var x = 5 var y = 50 \"); var variableList = script.GetGlobalVariables(); foreach (var v in variableList) { Debug.WriteLine($\"{v.Name} = {v.Value} Is constant = {v.IsConstant}\"); } Returned variables objects types can be: int, double, string and ArrayList. GetAllFunctions Returns an array of strings with all the function signatures found in current environment. Note Extensions functions arguments names are returned as arg0..argN. However, the DUE functions will have the parameter name as specified in the source code. ResetEnvironment When a script is executed, it leaves all declared functions and variables available in the environment. Can be accessed though later scripts."

Tip Variable binding is not supported and should not be used, only use variables that are readonly . Acessing Extensions The DUE ScriptEngine does all the necessary magic internally. The user only needs to provide the extension class. var script = new ScriptEngine(typeof(ExtensionLibrary)); script.Run(@\"ExtensionFuncSample(\"\"Hello DUE!\"\") var x = ExtensionAdder(44, 77) ExtensionFuncSample(\"\"x: \"\" + x) \"); Similar to any other functions in DUE, extensions can also be invoked from the engine directly engine.Invoke(\"ExtensionFuncSample\",\"Hello DUE!\") .

    "title": "DUE Scripting Language",
    "keywords": "DUE Scripting Language Why DUE? DUE stands for Dynamic, Universal and Extensible. A user-friendly scripting language with full debugging capabilities. Dynamic Arguably, DUE is the most user-friendly programming language out there! It is so Dynamic, it supports multiple coding styles. BASIC-style If temp > 60 Print \"Too Hot!\" end C-style if (temp > 60) { print (\"Too Hot!\"); } Python-style If (temp > 60): Print (\"Too Hot!\") DUE simply understand any of the most common formats. Users can even mix and match! Mixing styles between styles within the same block is not supported. This code is not allowed and will raise an error: If (temp > 60) { Print (\"Too Hot!\") end C-style and BASIC-style ignore white-space as how the style work. The Python-style however needs the proper indentation, just like expected by the full python language. Universal DUE uses syntax that is universally used and common among most popular programming languages. Comments, variables, constants are some of the examples. While not found in most scripting languages, DUE has full built-in debugging capability similar to any world-class language. Extensible Users can extend the DUE available functions, right from C#. Learn more at the Extensions page. Getting Started The API has examples on how to use DUE ScriptEngine to write a script using the available statements . DUES comes with several Standard Library functions. Developers have a ways to securely add Extensions to give DUE additional functionality. When programs get to be more complex, debugging will come in handy. Comments Comments are ignored text added to help developers read code. // This is a comment print x // This is also a comment #this is a python-style comment Understanding Environment The ScriptEngine takes a script and compiles it and then it will run any top level statements. Any functions and variables are loaded in the environment, and will still be there even when execution has completed. This script Foo(x) will raise an error. There is no Foo function and no variable x in the script. Now this script is ran: var x=5 func Foo(s) print s end While the earlier script will not do anything, it actually loads the environment with a variable and a function. Running the first script now works fine Foo(x) . Samples Recursion func factorial(n) if n == 0 return 1 end return n * factorial(n - 1) end print(factorial(5)) if func ToWords(i) if i < 10 return i + \" units\" elseif i < 100 return i + \" tens\" elseif i < 1000 return i + \" hundreds\" else return i + \" thousands\" end end print(ToWords(3)) print(ToWords(55)) print(ToWords(432)) print(ToWords(2342)) while var i = 1 while i <= 10 print(i) i = i + 1 end PI const scale = 10000 const arrinit = 2000 func pi_digits(digits) var carry = 0 var arr = [] var result = [] // Adjust digits for groups of 4 digits = (digits * 14) / 4 // Initialize array var i = 0 while i < digits + 1 append(arr, arrinit) i = i + 1 end // Calculate digits i = digits while i > 0 var sum = 0 var j = i while j > 0 sum = sum * j + scale * arr[j] arr[j] = sum % (j * 2 - 1) sum = trunc(sum / (j * 2 - 1)) j = j - 1 end append(result, carry + trunc(sum / scale)) carry = sum % scale i = i - 14 end return result end var result = pi_digits(20)"

By default, cls does not do anything but print will simply call Debug.WriteLine internally. The behavior can be change, to forward the output to a serial port or a display for example. See API page from more details. Tip print will format double ToString(\"N4\") Execution Statements while , if / elseif / else , continue , break and 'return' work just like most globally-acceptable programming languages. The end statement DUE supports multiple code block types. When basic-style is selected, the end statement marks the end of a block. if x > 10 print x end In the case other style is used, like C-style, using end is not needed and not allowed. if (x>10) { print(x); } This is not allowed if (x>10){ print(x); end var var is how variables are created. var will automatically select the correct type and will even change the type on the next assignment, like change it from numerical to string. Numerical Variables are always double-type and must always have a starting value var x = 10 is good but var x is not allowed. Strings var s = \"Hello DUE\" creates a variable of a string type. Just like modern languages, strings can be combined. var s = \"Hello \" + \"DUE\" . With strings, numerical variable or constants are automatically converted to strings internally. print \"x= \" + x . Both single quote and double-quote are supported and work the same. print 'hi' . Arrays Arrays, and arrays of arrays, are supported. It is important to note that arrays hold an array of var and each var in itself can be any kind, even another array. var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] var names = [\"DUE\", \"is\", \"amazing\"] var mix = [\"Hi\", 55, 96.34] Arrays can even contain other arrays var setsOfNumbers = [[1,3,5], [2,4,6]] Array elements are indexed starting zero. var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] print numbers[2] // Will access the 3rd element in the array Creating an empty array is supported var arr = [] . Tip Creating an empty array of specific length is supported through the Array functions from Standard Library . const const is a special type of variable that can't be changed. const x = 5 const s = \"Hello\" // these are not allowed x = 10 s = \"Bye!\" Arrays are slightly different as in the values can be changed but not the array itself. const a = [1, 2, 5] a[2] = 3 // this is not allowed a = 5 Functions (func) Functions are added using func statement. func printsomething() print(\"Hello There!\") end printsomething() Of course, curly brackets can be used instead, and even semicolons! func printsomething() { print \"Hello There!\"; } printsomething() Passing arguments to functions is supported. func greet(name) print \"Hello \" + name end greet(\"Gus\") // This will show Hello Gus on the output window Functions can also return values func add(x, y) return x + y end var answer = add(32, 10) Functions can also be added from C# through Extensions . Boolean Operators Some programming languages use && and some use AND to check of 2 statements are true, similarly they have || and OR. if speed > 100 AND temp < 32 print \"Slow down!\" end if (speed > 200 && temp < -40) { print(\"Goodbye!\"); } Bitwise Operators Not currently supported."

It covers device and computer setup and deployment of a \"hello world\" program to a SITCore device. Compatible Hardware TinyCLR OS is made to run on our SITCore line of products. Check out the SITCore page in the hardware section of this documentation to find the device best suited for your project. TinyCLR Device Setup To use TinyCLR with a device you must first install the latest version of the TinyCLR firmware on the device. The TinyCLR firmware includes the Common Language Runtime (CLR) which converts compiled code into machine instructions and manages program execution. The TinyCLR firmware is also responsible for interacting with Microsoft Visual Studio to load and debug your application programs. Use the TinyCLR Config tool to update the firmware on your device to the latest version. Development Machine Setup If you don't already have Visual Studio 2022, download and install one of the latest editions. Any edition will work, including the free community edition: Visual Studio Community . Make sure to select the .NET desktop development workload when installing Visual Studio. Download and install the newest TinyCLR Visual Studio Project System by going to Extensions > Manage Extensions . In the Manage Extensions dialog box select Online in the left panel. Type tinyclr into the Search text box in the upper right of the window to search for and install the TinyCLR OS Project System . You'll need to restart Visual Studio to let the extension installer complete the installation. Alternately you can download the Visual Studio Project System from our Downloads page and open or double click on the file to install the extension. Note Pre-releases of the Project System are not hosted online but are found on the Downloads page. Starting a New Project Let's blink an LED on a SITCore board. Open Visual Studio and select Create a new project . In the Create a new project window , select TinyCLROS from the platforms drop down list. Now select the C# TinyCLR Application template and click the Next button. We're going to stick with the default name and location. If you use a different name, make sure the program's namespace statement matches the namespace of your program. Now click on the \"Create\" button. Now cut and paste the following code into the Program.cs window. Make sure to install both GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio and GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins NuGet packages . using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; using System.Threading; namespace TinyCLRApplication1 { class Program { static void Main() { //Use \"SC20100.GpioPin.PE11\" on SC20100S Dev Board. //Use \"SC20260.GpioPin.PB0\" on SCM20260D Dev Board. var LED = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20100.GpioPin.PB0); LED.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); while (true) { LED.Write(GpioPinValue.High); Thread.Sleep(100); LED.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); Thread.Sleep(100); } } } } Make sure your device is plugged into the computer's USB port. Now hit the start button as shown on the above image (or hit the F5 key). If you've done everything correctly, the program will compile and deploy to your device. The left most LED on the dev board should blink if you've done everything correctly. Top Level Statements The use of C#9 Top Level Statements allows for easier to read example code snippets. The docs will utilize top level statements when possible. The TinyCLR project system templates include a C#9 application template. To use Top Level Statements: Start a new project, but this time select TinyCLR Application C#9 . install both GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio and GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins NuGet packages . Copy/paste the code below.

    "title": "Limitations",
    "keywords": "Limitations TinyCLR OS is made to run on small, secure, IoT devices. TinyCLR was built from the ground up with security first and foremost. Performance is also excellent, but we did have to limit some of the less important features to achieve this performance while maximizing application memory. Here is a list of limitations and possible workarounds: There is no support for multidimensional arrays, use jagged arrays instead. Simply use [1][1] instead of [1,1]. Each assembly is limited to 64KB. If you have gigantic code, just split your solution into multiple assemblies. This approach improves code maintainability as well. Resource files are not subject to this limitation, so if you are adding large lookup tables or binary objects, include them as a resource. There is a limit of 64 total assemblies. TinyCLR does not support generics. While this is less of a limitation on an embedded device than on the desktop, we understand that professional .NET developers will miss this feature. However, on small embedded systems implementing generics can reduce performance. The async/await pattern is not supported. All libraries, networking sockets for example, are tweaked to be a subset of the full .NET framework that will perform well on embedded devices. These tweaks have allowed us to support essential IoT features like CAN and USB."

    "keywords": "Special Pins Beside power and standard GPIO pins, there are a number of predefined pins that have special functionality on SITCore SoMs and SoCs: RESET LDR APP MOD WKUP VBAT All special pins except RESET and VBAT can be used as GPIO or peripheral pins, however it is up to the designer to make sure these pins do not interfere with their special features. RESET The SITCore chip is held in reset while the RESET(NRST) pin is held low. Releasing RESET and allowing it to go high will begin the system startup process. All SITCore processors have a permanent internal pull up resistor on the RESET pin. An external pull up resistor is not required on the RESET(NRST) pin. LDR The LDR pin is normally pulled high during startup or reset, allowing TinyCLR OS to run. When the LDR pin is pulled low during startup or reset, the device enters GHI Electronics bootloader mode, which is used to load the firmware. LDR has an internal pull up resistor. The Bootloader page details its use. APP The APP pin is used to prevent the application from running. The APP pin is checked shortly after startup. When the APP pin is high the application will run normally; otherwise, the system will not run the application and hold waiting for new deployment. The pin has an internal pull up resistor. If desired, the APP pin feature can be disabled so the application can't be stopped. See Device Info for more details. MOD The MOD pin is used to select the debugging/deployment interface, as explained in the Debugging tutorial. WKUP The WKUP pin is used to wake the system up from Shut Down mode. See the Power Management page for more information. VBAT The VBAT pin on SITCore SoCs and SoMs is used to provide battery power to the Real Time Clock (RTC) and its battery backed memory. Debug Interface USB or Serial can be used for debugging ."

    "keywords": "TinyCLR Config TinyCLR Config is a stand-alone tool to help manage TinyCLR OS devices, including firmware installation and creating encrypted application deployments and loading them onto SITCore devices. There is also a Debug panel that shows any debug data coming from the connected device. You can download TinyCLR Config from the Downloads page. Connecting a Device When TinyCLR Config opens, you will notice a Device section near the top of its window. Connect your device to your PC's USB port and click on the Select a device drop down text box. The name of your device should appear. Click on the device and hit the Connect button. The Assemblies menu there is an Assemblies Listing command that will list all the assemblies installed on the connected device along with their version number. The Utilities top menu has options to ping the device using the Ping command. There are also options in the Utilities menu to reboot the device, show a deployment map, or update the device configuration. Deployment Map The deployment map can be used to gauge the resources used by your application, but more importantly it allows you to make sure assemblies are stored in secure internal flash memory. See the IP Protection page for more information about secure assemblies. Device Configuration The device configuration window contains options that have important implications on the system and its security. There are two regions for holding configurations, the Firmware Config and the Application Config. Firmware Configuration These firmware settings are stored in flash and can only be modified by reflashing the firmware or by doing an Erase all . The Extend heap uses the external RAM for the system, which reduces the level of security. This is explained further under External Memory . Persist slow clock Sets the system clock speed to run at half speed, saving about 40% power consumption. See Power Management . 'Disable APP pin', Debug Mode and Device Name options change/disable the MOD and APP pins behavior. Those pins are explained under Device Info . Application Configuration There Application configuration are stored and flash and can only be reset by doing an 'Erase all` only. Updating the firmware will have no effect. For added security, the debug interface can be disabled. Secure designs will disable the interface and implement In-Field-Update . You can also disable the debug interface from within your code. Please refer to the IP Protection page for more information about disabling the debug interface. Managing TinyCLR Firmware TinyCLR Config can be used to install/update TinyCLR firmware on a connected device. The firmware is the TinyCLR software installed on your device that runs and manages your application program. To update your firmware, click on the ... button to the left of the Update Firmware button. A dialog box will open so you can select your firmware file. Only .ghi and .glb files will be recognized. After selecting your firmware file, click on the Update Firmware button to copy it to your device. In the Erase menu, the Erase All selection will erase the firmware on the device, but will also erase the application. While it's not necessary to delete the firmware or the application to install new firmware, it can sometimes help if your device stops working properly. Managing Your Application TinyCLR Config lets you create and deploy encrypted application files. A key is needed to install an encrypted application deployment file on your device. This key can be generated by TinyCLR Config or provided by you. Creating a Deployment File To create an encrypted deployment, you must first have the application installed on your device and the device must be connected to TinyCLR Config. A key is needed to encrypt your deployment file. Either enter a key into the key text box (hexadecimal pairs delimited by hyphens) or just press the Generate Key button to generate a random key. If you want to add a version number to your deployment, enter it in the Version of created app: text box. Click on the ... button next to the Create App button and select a directory and enter a filename for your deployment file. Now press the Create App button. The encrypted deployment file and a text file with the key will be saved in the directory you selected. Installing a Deployment File To install an encrypted deployment file on your device, first use TinyCLR Config to connect to your device. Click on the ... button next to the Update App button and select the deployment file (should have a .tca extension). Enter the correct key in the text box next to the Generate Key button. The key is a series of hexadecimal pairs that are separated by hyphens. Now click on the Update App button. If the key matches the deployment file, the application will be deployed to your device."

    "keywords": "Adafruit IO The Adafruit cloud, Adafruit IO, is a cloud service primarily aimed at the maker market. While Adafruit IO is more limited than the major players in cloud services, it is very easy to use and there's a free option making this a great way to test IoT proofs of concept and prototypes. We'll need create a few things for our code. We'll need an Adafruit Certificate, a dashboardID, a username, a password key, and a feed to subscribe to. First download the required Adafruit Root Certificate and add to resources. The TLS Client shows how to download the root certificate. var caCertSource = Resources.GetBytes(Resources.BinaryResources.DigiCertGlobalRootG2); Next, we'll create a 'Dashboard', from the Dashboards page. Click on 'Create a New Dashboard' found inside the 'Actions' dropdown. Create a meaningful name for our Dashboard. This will be the 'dashboardID' inside our code sample. Click on our newly created 'Dashboard' This opens the Dashboard canvas for our project. This is where we will add blocks to control our IoT device. Click on '+' to create a new block. Let's add our first block to the canvas. There are many kinds of blocks you can add, for this we'll first add a 'Toggle' block. Click on the 'Toggle' block. We need to create a 'feed' name to attach to our newly created block. Enter a name for the feed and click 'Create'. In our example we'll call this block's feed 'ToggleSwitch' Check the box of the newly created feed and click 'Next Step' Here we can set the Text we want to use that appears on the button and the value the button will send when used. Let's change the Button value to 1 for on and 0 for off. Then click 'Create block' The new Toogle we created now appears in the Dashboard canvas, the blocks can be placed anywhere we like on the Dashboard. But let's add another block first. Let's add a 'Gauge' block to our canvas next. Like we did the ToggleSwitch feed, we need to create a feed for the Gauge. We'll just call the feed 'Gauge', click on the 'Create', select the 'Gauge' and click 'Next step' There are several setting we can adjust but for this tutorial we'll just us the default and click on 'Create block' We can see that the gauge has been added to our Dashboard Canvas. The final element we need for our code is an 'Adafruit IO Key'. Click on it located in the top menu. Copy the generated key... ...and paste in our code as shown in the example below. var key = \"aio_XXJy54zT7H0X89PMZhUwlsfA7\"; We now have all the elements we need to complete the code in our sample. Here are the values we created and need to add. var dashboardId = \"SITCore\"; var username = \"Your Username\"; var key = \"aio_XXJy54zT7H0X89PMZhUwlsfA7\"; var feed = \"your username/feeds/ToggleSwitch\"; Deploy your program to your SITCore IoT device, once launched the gauge on our Dashboard will start at 50 and increment by 5 every 2 seconds. Clicking on the 'Toggle Switch' will send the value to our device, which can be seen in Visual Studio's output window. Using MQTT var caCertSource = Resources.GetBytes(Resources.BinaryResources.DigiCertGlobalRootG2); X509Certificate CaCert = new X509Certificate(caCertSource); var mqttHost = \"io.adafruit.com\"; var mqttPort = 8883; //Default SSL port is 8883, default insecure port is 1883. var dashboardId = \"Your Dashboard\"; var username = \"Your Username\"; var key = \"Your Adafruit IO Key\"; var feed = \"Feed you wish to subscribe to\"; try { var clientSetting = new MqttClientSetting { BrokerName = mqttHost, BrokerPort = mqttPort, ClientCertificate = null, CaCertificate = CaCert, SslProtocol = System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.Tls12, }; var client = new Mqtt(clientSetting); var connectSetting = new MqttConnectionSetting { ClientId = dashboardId, UserName = username, Password = key }; // Connect to host var returnCode = client.Connect(connectSetting); if(returnCode == ConnectReturnCode.ConnectionAccepted) Debug.WriteLine(\"Connected to Adafruit IO\"); var packetId = 1; // Subscribe to a feed client.Subscribe(new string[] {feed}, new QoSLevel[] { QoSLevel.ExactlyOnce }, (ushort)packetId++); // Publish to a feed client.PublishReceivedChanged += Client_PublishReceivedChanged; var dx = 5; var x = 50; while (true) { x += dx; if (x >= 100 || x <= 0) dx *= -1; // Publish a topic client.Publish(\"your username/feeds/gauge\", Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\" \" + x), QoSLevel.MostOnce, false, (ushort)packetId); //Sets gauge Thread.Sleep(2000); } } catch (Exception e) { } Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } private static void Client_PublishReceivedChanged(object sender, string topic, byte[] data, bool duplicate, QoSLevel qosLevel, bool retain) { if (data[0] == '1') { //Toggle is set to '1' Debug.WriteLine(\"ToggleSwitch set to 1\"); } if (data[0] == '0') { //Toggle is set to '0' Debug.WriteLine(\"ToggleSwitch set to 0\"); } } Using HTML Your IoT device can communicate with Adafruit IO using simple HTTP GET and POST commands. However, to respond to input on your Adafruit IO dashboard you must repeatedly execute HTTP GET requests to poll the input. If you would rather use event driven input from Adafruit IO, MQTT is a better choice than HTML. The following code uses an HTTP POST request to send a value to an Adafruit IO feed named \"Gauge\" which is represented by a gauge on an Adafruit IO dashboard. It uses a secure connection, so you must have the Adafruit certificate loaded as a resource .

Microcontrollers based on 3.3V can typically read voltages anywhere between zero and 3.3V. Analog inputs connect internally to an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) that converts the analog voltage level on the pin to a digital value. Tip Note that the analog channel number is not the pin number. You need to determine the channel number of a specific pin using your system's documentation. The resolution of the ADC determines its accuracy. An 8bit ADC has 256 steps to work with, 3.3V/256=0.013V. This means an increase of 0.013V will increase the ADC value by one.

We need an iotEndPoint, a deviceId, an AWS root certificate, a client certificate and a private key. First, you'll need to create an AWS account. Once you've created your account, we need to find the service to set up our device. On the AWS Management Console, search for the service 'IoT Core' and select it. Before we add our device, we need to create a Policy that the device will use. From the side menu under the 'Secure' tab click 'Polices' click on the button to create a new policy. Name your policy and then click on advanced mode. Paste the code found below in the code window. Then click the 'Create' button. We'll attach the policy to the device later. Paste this code in the above window. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"iot:Publish\", \"iot:Subscribe\", \"iot:Connect\", \"iot:Receive\" ], \"Resource\": [ \"*\" ] } ] } Now we need to create our IoT device within AWS. Click on the 'Manage' Dropdown and select 'Things', then click on 'Register a thing' Next, we click on 'Create a single thing' Now we'll create a Name for our IoT device and add it to the 'Things' registry. This will be the deviceId we will use in the code sample. There are other options available that can be added, but in this tutorial, we only need to create a 'Name' and click 'NEXT' The next page is where we'll create the CA Certificates, we need to add to our projects resources. In this case we can use the 'One-Click certificate creation'. Click on 'Create certificate' Next we need to download the CA Certificates we need. We need 'A certificates for this thing' and 'the private key', we don't need to download the public key for this project. You'll also need an AWS root certificate, you can follow the link to download RSA 2048 bit key: Amazon Root CA 1. Next we need to click on the 'Activate' button to activate the certificates we created, then click 'Attach a policy' Check the box for the 'Policy' we created earlier, and then click the 'Register Thing' button. Add the 3 Certificates we downloaded to Resources in our project and SAVE your project. Inside the 'Things' registry list click on the device you just created. Once you're on your devices dashboard, click on the 'Interact' tab. This will give you the iotEndPoint we'll need for our code. Copy the code... ...and paste it into the code as shown below. Also add the name of your device to the variable deviceId. var iotEndPoint = \"a13gxtasnslh-ats.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\"; var iotPort = 8883; var deviceId = \"MyDevice\"; Finally, we need to link the CA Certificates we placed in our project resources to our code as shown in the example below. var caCertSorce = Resources.GetBytes(Resources.BinaryResources.AmazonRootCA1); var clientCertSource = Resources.GetBytes(Resources.BinaryResources._3a59c69926_certificate_pem); var privateKeyData = Resources.GetBytes(Resources.BinaryResources._3a59c69926_private_pem); You can now deploy your program in Visual Studio, to connect your device to AWS. Clicking on the 'Activity' Tab on our device dashboard will show the active connection. We view the messages being sent from our IoT device to AWS by clicking on the 'Shadows' Tab, then click 'Classic Shadows'. The message in the window is sent from our device... We can edit the message being sent from the device in Visual Studio by changing the message in this line of our code. var Message = \"{\\\"state\\\":{\\\"desired\\\":{\\\"My message\\\":\\\"Hello World\\\"}}}\";"

It is generally a two wire bus, but other transceivers with one wire or LSFT (Low Speed Fault Tolerant) are used. The common high-speed two-wire CAN requires termination resistors at the end of the wires, typically 120 ohm. Tip Some CAN devices, including our own development boards, have built in termination resistors. CAN bit timing is a complex topic that requires considerable knowledge of the CAN protocol. All nodes on a CAN network must use the same baud rate. Sample bit timing settings are provided further down on this page to help you get started. SetNominalBitTiming() and SetDataBitTiming() define the CAN bus timing using the arguments listed below. Note that SetDataBitTiming() is only used for CAN-FD to specify the faster data rate. SetNominalBitTiming() is used both for standard CAN and to define the slower data bit rate for CAN-FD. Tip The propagationPhase1 argument combines the propagation and phase1 CAN timing parameters.

There are many online CAN calculators that can be used to help you with CAN timing, for example . The CAN calculator needs the microcontroller's CAN clock speed. For the SITCore series SC20xxx, this is 48 MHz. For the SC13xxx the speed is 40MHz. These can easily be found with SourceClock property. Filtering Filters can be set to automatically accept or ignore messages based on their arbitration ID. Tip On SC20xxx, each CAN channel supports up to 64 standard IDs and 32 Extended IDs. SC13xxx supports up to 14 filters. Range Filter AddRangeFilter() allows you to set a range of arbitration IDs that will be accepted as valid messages. Messages with arbitration IDs outside of this range will be ignored. You can add more than one range filter. In the sample code below, the range filters will accept messages with arbitration IDs ranging from 0x12 to 0x20 and also between 0x500 and 0x1000 inclusive. Note Only SC20xxx supports Range Filter, SC13xxx doesn't. Mask Filter AddMaskFilter() can be used to specify an individual arbitration ID or a range of arbitration IDs that will be accepted regardless of the group filter settings. If the arbitration ID of the message is bitwise anded with the given mask argument, and the result is equal to the compare argument you provide, the message will be accepted. In the sample code below, CAN messages with arbitration IDs of 0x11 , 0x13 , and 0x5678 will be accepted in addition to the arbitration IDs specified by the group filters.

At the same time, CAN-FD is compatible with traditional CAN -- CAN-FD and standard CAN nodes can even coexist on the same CAN bus! CAN-FD can be used by setting the FdCan property of your CAN message to true . This setting will allow you to send up to 64 bytes of data per CAN message. To send the data at higher speed you will also need to set two bit timings, one for the normal, slower speed ( SetNominalBitTiming() ), and one for the faster speed ( SetDataBitTiming() ).

Security Clarification Most users of embedded systems that connect to mobile networks assume they are secure, but often they are not. Typically, a serial connection with AT commands is used to communicate with the Internet. While the data over the air is secure, all data transmitted over the serial connection is raw unencrypted data that can be easily scoped. This is not the case with TinyCLR OS. With TinyCLR OS, serial data between the device and the modem is encrypted. All data handling is done internally inside the core processor, which is extremely difficult to hack into."

    "keywords": "Collections Similar data can often be handled more efficiently when stored and manipulated as a collection. You can use the System.Array class or the classes in the System.Collections namespace to add, remove, and modify either individual elements or a range of elements in a collection. For more info go to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/collections/index . TinyCLR OS collections support ArrayLists, Hash tables, Stacks, and Queues. ArrayLists ArrayLists have a significant advantage over arrays in that ArrayLists are automatically resized as needed, whereas arrays are limited to a fixed number of elements. The following code sample creates an ArrayList, adds a couple of records, and then iterates through the ArrayList items and displays each record. class Program { private struct rmaRecord { public System.DateTime date; public string modelNumber; public string fault; } private static void Main() { var rmaList = new System.Collections.ArrayList(); var record = new rmaRecord(); record.date = new System.DateTime(2020, 2, 21); record.modelNumber = \"XY23\"; record.fault = \"No power\"; rmaList.Add(record); record.date = new System.DateTime(2020, 2, 20); record.modelNumber = \"XY42\"; record.fault = \"Blown fuse\"; rmaList.Add(record); PrintValues(rmaList); } private static void PrintValues(System.Collections.ArrayList list) { System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\"Count: \" + list.Count); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\"Capacity: \" + list.Capacity); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\" \"); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\"Values:\"); foreach (rmaRecord record in list) { System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\" Date: \" + record.date.Year + \"/\" + record.date.Month + \"/\" + record.date.Day); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\" Model#: \" + record.modelNumber); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\" Fault: \" + record.fault); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\"----------\"); } } } The above code outputs the following: Count: 2 Capacity: 4 Values: Date: 2020/2/21 Model#: XY23 Fault: No power ---------- Date: 2020/2/20 Model#: XY42 Fault: Blown fuse ---------- In the above sample, rmaList.Clear() will remove all elements from rmaList , rmaList.RemoveAt(1) will remove only the second element in the list, and rmaList.Remove(record) will remove the first element that is equal to record . Hash tables Hash tables are used to store information in a way that associates each data element, or value, with a key that can be used to look up that value. Hash tables make it easy to quickly retrieve information that would otherwise be difficult to organize in an efficient manner. For example, imagine trying to look up a phone number from a given name. You could make a two dimension array of names and phone numbers and then iterate through the array looking for the correct name, but this would be slow with a large array. Hash tables solve this problem by using a hash function to convert a key, in this case a name, into an array index that points directly to the data element you are looking for. This allows you to quickly retrieve the data directly instead of searching for it. The following code sample creates a hash table, adds elements to the hash table, and then reads back the value for each key. //Create a hash table. System.Collections.Hashtable processorPin = new System.Collections.Hashtable(); //Add some elements to the hash table. There can be no duplicate keys, but duplicate // values are allowed. // Key Value processorPin.Add(\"LDR\", \"PE3\"); processorPin.Add(\"APP\", \"PB7\"); processorPin.Add(\"MOD\", \"PD7\"); processorPin.Add(\"WKUP\", \"PA0\"); processorPin.Add(\"BTN1\", \"PE3\"); processorPin.Add(\"BTN2\", \"PB7\"); processorPin.Add(\"BTN3\", \"PD7\"); //If a key does not exist, setting the default Item property //for that key adds a new key/value pair. processorPin[\"BTN4\"] = \"PD9\"; //When you use foreach to enumerate hash table elements, the elements are retrieved // as DictionaryEntry objects. foreach (System.Collections.DictionaryEntry de in processorPin) { System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\"Key = \" + de.Key + \" Value = \" + de.Value); } The above code outputs the following: Key = MOD Value = PD7 Key = LDR Value = PE3 Key = BTN1 Value = PE3 Key = BTN2 Value = PB7 Key = BTN3 Value = PD7 Key = BTN4 Value = PD9 Key = WKUP Value = PA0 Key = APP Value = PB7 Stacks Stacks are first in, last out (or last in, first out) collections of objects. The Push method is used to add items to a stack, and the Pop method is used to remove items from a stack. There is also a Peek method that returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it from the stack. var sitCoreDevices = new System.Collections.Stack(); sitCoreDevices.Push(\"SC20100S\"); sitCoreDevices.Push(\"SC20260B\"); sitCoreDevices.Push(\"SCM20260D\"); sitCoreDevices.Push(\"SCM20260E\"); sitCoreDevices.Push(\"SCM20260N\"); PrintValues(sitCoreDevices); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\"Popped: \" + sitCoreDevices.Pop().ToString()); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\" \"); PrintValues(sitCoreDevices); void PrintValues(System.Collections.Stack myQueue) { System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\"Count: \" + myQueue.Count); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\"Items in queue:\"); foreach (System.Object obj in myQueue) System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\" \" + obj); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\" \"); } The above code outputs the following: The thread '<No Name>' (0x2) has exited with code 0 (0x0).

    "keywords": "Displays Graphical Displays can be grouped into two distinct interface categories, built-in parallel TFT displays and virtual displays, typically serial (SPI/I2C) displays. There are also non-graphical character displays and those work through a simple driver, not using the graphics . The display drivers are meant to transfer the pixel data from memory to the actual display. The graphics tutorial shows how drawing is done in memory. Native Displays These displays connect to special dedicated pins on the processor. Internally, the display controller automatically transfers (refreshes) the display directly from memory without any processor interaction, using DMA. When the system needs to update the display, it simply writes to memory. Neither the operating system nor the application program are burdened with display processing. The down side to this is that the system needs to have enough RAM to handle the display. An 800x600 display with 16bpp needs 960,000 bytes! Virtual Displays The internal graphics services can be mapped to work with virtual display displays, such as SPI displays. See the Graphics tutorial for more information and sample code. Character Displays These displays are capable of only showing characters. Most of these displays use the HD44780 controller. They are available in different sizes, but two lines of 16 characters is most common. These displays only require GPIO pins and can be used with TinyCLR. Sample code for HD44780 displays can be found in our GitHub Samples Repo . Low Level Display Access TinyCLR also provides low level display access as part of the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Display library. These methods provide a simple way to write to a display without need for the System.Drawing library or an added font resource file. Tip The low level support should only be used in advanced edge cases only. The following example is written for the SC20260D Dev Board with the 4.3\" display. It will paint the screen as shown in the picture beneath the code. Note that low level display access requires that you use the data format required by your display as configured.

Strings and Arrays The Encoding class is used to convert between strings, character arrays, and byte arrays.

BitConverter The BitConverter class is used to convert from one data type to another. For example, to convert an integer into a byte array: var byteArray = System.BitConverter.GetBytes(23); //byteArray[0] = 23, byteArray[1] = 0, byteArray[2] = 0, byteArray[3] = 0 byteArray = System.BitConverter.GetBytes(65536); //byteArray[0] = 0, byteArray[1] = 0, byteArray[2] = 1, byteArray[3] = 0 You can also convert from a byte array to a string, but the results are different than the results from the Encoding class: var string = System.BitConverter.ToString(new byte[] { 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 }); //string = \"41-42-43-44-45\" (hexadecimal values delimited by hyphens). var string = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(new byte[] { 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 }); //string = \"ABCDE\" BitConverter Overloads Convert to a Byte Array System.BitConverter.GetBytes(char value) System.BitConverter.GetBytes(double value) System.BitConverter.GetBytes(float value) System.BitConverter.GetBytes(int value) System.BitConverter.GetBytes(long value) System.BitConverter.GetBytes(short value) System.BitConverter.GetBytes(uint value) System.BitConverter.GetBytes(ulong value) System.BitConverter.GetBytes(ushort value) System.BitConverter.GetBytes(bool value) Convert from a Byte Array System.BitConverter.ToBoolean(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) System.BitConverter.ToChar(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) System.BitConverter.ToDouble(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) System.BitConverter.ToInt16(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) System.BitConverter.ToInt32(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) System.BitConverter.ToInt64(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) System.BitConverter.ToSingle(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) System.BitConverter.ToString(byte[] bytes) System.BitConverter.ToString(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) System.BitConverter.ToString(byte[] bytes, int startIndex, int length) System.BitConverter.ToUInt16(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) System.BitConverter.ToUInt32(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) System.BitConverter.ToUInt64(byte[] bytes, int startIndex) Convert Between Double and Long System.BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits(double value) System.BitConverter.Int64BitsToDouble(long value) Swap Endianness SwapEndianness(byte[] data, int groupSize, int index, int size); String Handling ToString() Supported Conversions As TinyCLR OS is a subset of the full desktop .NET development system, not all desktop .NET features are supported. The following ToString() arguments are supported: Debug.WriteLine(123.ToString(\"N4\")); //Outputs 123.0000 Debug.WriteLine(123.ToString(\"F4\")); //Outputs 123.0000 Debug.WriteLine(123.ToString(\"D4\")); //Outputs 0123 Debug.WriteLine(123.ToString(\"G4\")); //Outputs 123 Debug.WriteLine(123.ToString(\"X4\")); //Outputs 007B The following ToString() arguments are not supported and will raise an exception: Debug.WriteLine(123.ToString(\"E4\")); //'E' option not supported Debug.WriteLine(123.ToString(\"R4\")); //'R' option not supported Debug.WriteLine(123.ToString(\"P4\")); //'P' option not supported Debug.WriteLine(123.ToString(\"C2\")); //'C' option not supported StringBuilder As strings are immutable, manipulating strings, especially in a tight loop, can impact system performance and increase memory usage and fragmentation. Because strings cannot be changed, every time you manipulate a string a new string is created and the original string becomes garbage. The StringBuilder class uses a string buffer to improve the performance of string manipulation, allowing you to manipulate strings instead of creating new strings. The following example changes the content of a string without creating a new string. var sb = new System.Text.StringBuilder(\"PA0 is the pin to use.\"); sb[1] = 'B'; System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(sb.ToString()); //Will output \"PB0 is the pin to use.\" StringBuilder is also great when you want to build strings by concatenating characters or other strings. Without StringBuilder, each time you add a character to a string, a new string is created and the old string becomes garbage. The following code creates a string one character at a time without creating all the garbage strings. var sb = new System.Text.StringBuilder(); for (int i=48; i<58; i++) { sb.Append((char)i); } Debug.WriteLine(sb.ToString()); //Will output \"0123456789\" Color Space Internally TinyCLR uses the 5:6:5 RGB 16BPP color space, requiring two bytes per pixel. Users may find the need to use a different color space. Conversion Convert(byte[] inArray, byte[] outArray, ColorFormat colorFormat, RgbFormat rgbFormat, byte alpha, byte[] colorTable) Users must create outArray of a length that is determined based on the ColorFormat the user is converting to. The table below will help in determining outArray buffer size. Color Space Desired size of outArray buffer 3:5:2 inArray.Length x 0.5 4:4:4 inArray.Length x 0.75 5:6:5 inArray.Length x 1 8:8:8 inArray.Length x 1.5 8:8:8:8 inArray.Length x 2.0 RgbFormat is used to swap colors is necessary. Tip Converting to from 5:6:5 to 5:6:5 doesn't convert the color space but it is useful to change the RgbFormat or scale using colorTable . The 64 values in colorTable maps each RGB original colors (6bit max from 5:6:5) to a new scaled color (up to 8bit in 8:8:8). This is optional as Convert will be default simply shift 6 bit up into 8 bits. This is an example of colorTable with more ideal results var ColorTable565To888 = new byte[64]{ 0,2,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,44,48,52,56,60,64,68,72,76,80,85,89,93,97,101,105,109,113,117,121,125,129,133,137,141,145,149,153,157,161,165,170,174,178,182,186,190,194,198,202,206,210,214,218,222,226,230,234,238,242,246,250 }; Tip The custom color table option is only available in 5:6:5, 8:8:8, and 8:8:8:8 color spaces. The alpha is only used with the 8:8:8:8 color space to set the alpha channel value, between 0(transparent) to 255(opaque). 1Bpp Conversion The ConvertTo1Bpp function converts the internal 5:6:5 color space to 1BPP. Any color will result in 1 and only black will result in 0. ConvertTo1Bpp(byte[] inArray, byte[] outArray, uint width) width is the pixel-width of the image that was used to create inArray . The outArray buffer size is = inArray.Length x 0.0625 By default, ConvertTo1Bpp groups each 8 pixels vertically, which is what most 1BPP display use. There is an overload that include BitFormat to change to horizontal if desired. ConvertTo1Bpp(byte[] inArray, byte[] outArray, uint width, BitFormat bitFormat)"

External RAM Devices with external RAM have the option of utilizing this memory as Unmanaged Heap . Unmanaged heap is great for storing large amounts of data, but it is not considered secure. Bitmaps and UnmanagedBuffer are automatically stored in unmanaged heap. Developers also have the option of extending core managed heap into unsecure external memory, in which case, it removes unmanaged heap space. This feature is a trade off between security and convenience -- it provides a large amount of managed heap space, but data is stored outside of the microcontroller chip where it's less secure. Please see the IP Protection page for more information. TinyCLR Config can be used to extend the heap into external SDRAM, as well as the following method, you'll also have to follow with software reset method: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.Memory.ExtendHeap() GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.Power.Reset(); External Flash An optional 16MB QSPI external flash can be used to increase the available flash memory. In fact, most SITCore SoMs/boards already include this 16MB external flash. The top 6MB of the optional external flash can be used to extend the deployment region, which holds the application and its resources. This is done by using TinyCLR Config or through code: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.Flash.EnableExtendDeployment() GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.Power.Reset(); Since external memory chips can be probed, TinyCLR supports Secure Assemblies . See the IP Protection page for more information. Tip TinyCLR Config can be used to display the internal Deployment Map . The entire 16MB of flash, or 10MB when deployment is extended, can be used directly by reading/writing raw sectors or using Tiny File System ."

    "title": "File System",
    "keywords": "File System The file system library is subset of the full .NET file system support. Most example should work with without minor changes. The internal drivers fully support FAT16 or FAT32 file systems, with no limitations beyond the FAT file system itself! Note The USB drive must have an MBR record, not a GPT table. FAT16 and FAT32 file systems are supported. Fat File System USB Mass Storage This allows file access on USB devices with MSC class, such as USB memory sticks. See the USB page. SD Card SD and MMC cards are fully supported as detailed on the SD tutorial page. Additionally, SPI SD drivers are also supported through the ManagedFileSystem software utility drivers . The example below requires the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.IO and GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Storage libraries and a device with an SD card. var sd = StorageController.FromName(SC20100.StorageController.SdCard); var drive = FileSystem.Mount(sd.Hdc); //Show a list of files in the root directory var directory = new DirectoryInfo(drive.Name); var files = directory.GetFiles(); foreach (var f in files) { System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(f.Name); } //Create a text file and save it to the SD card. var file = new FileStream($@\"{drive.Name}Test.txt\", FileMode.OpenOrCreate); var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(DateTime.UtcNow.ToString() + Environment.NewLine); file.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length); file.Flush(); FileSystem.Flush(sd.Hdc); Low-level Access You can access the raw underlying data of the storage provider by using the Provider property of the controller. Be careful when using this interface, however, as it bypasses any file system present and writes directly to the device. This is useful for implementing your own or otherwise unsupported file systems. var controller = StorageController.FromName (SC20100.StorageController.SdCard); controller.Provider.Read(address, buffer, 0, buffer.Length, -1); Tiny File System (TFS) Tiny File System(TFS) can be used to access any memory storage as a file system. All that is needed is a basic driver to Read, Write, and Erase these storages. Below is an example that uses the external flash through TFS. Note This example requires the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.IO.TinyFileSystem const int CLUSTER_SIZE = 1024; var tfs = new TinyFileSystem(new QspiMemory(), CLUSTER_SIZE); if (!tfs.CheckIfFormatted()) { //Do Format if necessary tfs.Format(); } else { // Mount tiny file system tfs.Mount(); } //Open to write using (var fsWrite = tfs.Create(\"settings.dat\")) { using (var wr = new StreamWriter(fsWrite)) { wr.WriteLine(\"This is TFS test\"); wr.Flush(); fsWrite.Flush(); } } //Open to read using (var fsRead = tfs.Open(\"settings.dat\", FileMode.Open)) { using (var rdr = new StreamReader(fsRead)) { System.String line; while ((line = rdr.ReadLine()) != null) { Debug.WriteLine(line); } } } Below is a basic driver implementation utilizing QSPI external flash.

    "keywords": "Font Support Fonts can be included in your TinyCLR application by adding them as a resource . Any TrueType font can be used after being converted to the .tcfnt format with the FontConverter tool. The Font Converter tool (found under downloads is a command line utility which does just that. Make sure to use this tool for any fonts you need, using old fonts from NETMF will not work. var screen = Graphics.FromHdc(displayController.Hdc); var font = Resource.GetFont(Resource.FontResources.NinaB); var greenPen = new Pen(Color.Green); screen.DrawString(\"Hello World!\", font, greenPen.Brush, 10, 100); screen.Flush(); Font Conversion To convert a font you must first make a .fntdef file which is a text file describing the font to convert as well as a number of other parameters. This file contains one option on each line. A minimal .fntdef file may look like this to have the standard ASCII characters. SelectFont \"FN:Arial,WE:400,HE:12,IT:0\" ImportRange 32 126 Tip This third-party tool can be handy for generating compatible fonts. Font Definition The .fntdef file options are as follows: Note The order of statements in the .fntdef file matters. For example, properties such as AntiAlias must be specified before the InputRange property. AddFontToProcess path Path is the path to the TrueType font you want to convert. If the path contains spaces, you must enclose it in quotes and escape any backslashes. Example: AddFontToProcess C:\\Windows\\Fonts\\Arial.ttf SelectFont \"selection string\" \"Selection string\" is a quoted string containing comma delimited fields indicating the characteristics of the font to convert. ConvertFont searches the TrueType fonts installed on your computer, as well as any fonts in the AddFontToProcess argument, for a font matching the characteristics in the selection string argument. The first match is converted. Using spaces around the commas or colons in selection string will result in errors. Field types are as follows: HE: Height in logical units. Use zero for default height, a positive number for cell height and a negative number for character height. WI: Width. Average width of characters in logical units. Set to zero for closest match based on aspect ratio. ES: Escapement angle in tenths of a degree. Negative numbers rotate clockwise, positive numbers rotate counterclockwise. WE: Weight of font in range of 0 to 1000. 400 is normal, 700 is bold. Set to zero for default weight. IT: Italic if set to 1 (IT:1). FN: Face name. Name of the typeface. FullName: Full name. The unique name of the font. For example: \"Monotype:Arial Regular (Microsoft).\" For example, SelectFont \"HE:12,WE:400,FN:Arial\" will look for a regular-weight font of height 12 with a face name of \"Arial.\" AdjustAscent adjustment Adjustment is integer number of EM units to adjust ascent. Can be positive or negative. Can only be used once per .fntdef file. If it is used more than once, only the last occurrence will be used. AdjustDescent adjustment Adjustment is integer number of EM units to adjust descent. Can be positive or negative. Can only be used once per .fntdef file. If it is used more than once, only the last occurrence will be used. AdjustExternalLeading adjustment Adjustment is integer number of EM units to adjust the external leading. Can be positive or negative. Can only be used once per .fntdef file. If it is used more than once, only the last occurrence will be used. AdjustInternalLeading adjustment Adjustment is integer number of EM units to adjust the internal leading. Can be positive or negative. Can only be used once per .fntdef file. If it is used more than once, only the last occurrence will be used. AdjustLeftMargin adjustment Adjustment is integer number of device units to add to the left margin. Can be positive or negative. Applies to the characters specified by the ImportRange statement that most closely follows this option. AdjustRightMargin adjustment Adjustment is integer number of EM units to add to the right margin. Can be positive or negative. Applies to the characters specified by the ImportRange statement that most closely follows this statement. AntiAlias level Level can be 1, 2, 4, or 8. Font bitmaps will contain 2, 5, 17, or 65 levels of gray respectively. Must come after the SelectFont statement specifying the font to which this statement applies. May be applied to a range of characters defined by the ImportRange option. ImportRange start end Start and end are Unicode character codes indicating the beginning and end of the range of characters to convert (inclusive). Can be applied multiple times to convert a non-contiguous range of characters. Must come after the SelectFont statement specifying the font to which this statement applies. Both arguments are required. To specify a single character, make start and end the same number. ImportRangeAndMap start end offset Specifies range of characters to convert starting with Unicode character start + offset and ending with character end + offset , inclusive. Can be applied multiple times to convert a non-contiguous range of characters. Must come after the SelectFont statement specifying the font to which this statement applies. NoDefaultCharacter Specifies that no default character will be substituted for characters not converted. Must come after the SelectFont statement specifying the font to which this statement applies. OffsetX adjustment Adjustment is an integer describing the number of EM units to shift character position left or right. Positive numbers shift to the left, and negative numbers shift to the right. Applies to characters specified by any ImportRange, ImportRangeAndMap, or SetAsDefaultCharacter statements that follow it in the .fntdef file. Subsequent OffsetX statements supersede all previous OffxetX statements in the same .fntdef file. OffsetY adjustment Adjustment is an integer describing the number of EM units to shift character position up or down. Positive numbers shift down, and negative numbers shift up. Applies to characters specified by any ImportRange, ImportRangeAndMap, or SetAsDefaultCharacter statements that follow it in the .fntdef file. Subsequent OffsetX statements supersede all previous OffxetX statements in the same .fntdef file. SetAsDefaultcharacter charcode \"Charcode is the Unicode character code for the default character to substitute for characters that weren't converted. SetDefaultcharacter Indicates that the default character of the currently selected TrueType font will be substituted for characters that weren't converted. Verbosity level Note Not currently supported, set to 0. Level can be 0, 1, or 2. Level 0 displays no details, level 1 displays font properties, and level 2 displays font and character properties and a diagram of each character. # Comments You can add comments to your .fntdef file by starting the comment line with the \"#\" character.

Let's create a new project. Click on 'Create Project' on the Manage resources dashboard. Next we'll need to create a meaningful name, for this project will call it SITCoreIoT. In the search box type 'IoT Core' and then select it. Next, we need to 'ENABLE' the Google Cloud IoT API. Next we'll need to create a Registry for our project. Click on 'CREATE REGISTRY' We need to create a 'Registry ID', select a cloud 'Region', and a create a 'Topic'. Finally, we need to click on the 'SHOW ADVANCED OPTIONS' Tab to finish the creation For this exercise we only need MQTT, and we've selected 'Debug' under Cloud Logging. This isn't necessary but will allow us to see device activity in the log and may be useful for more complex programs. Finally click the 'CREATE' button. Once created we're taken to the Registry details dashboard. We need to create our device by clicking on 'Devices' from the left menu. From the Device dashboard, click on 'CREATE A DEVICE' Before we continue, we'll need to generate both a Private and Public key that we can attach to our Device. This can be done with a program like OpenSSL (secure), or we can use a third-party site to generate one for us for testing (unsecure). For this exercise, we'll use a third-party site like: CryptoTool.net We need to select a Key Length of 2048, and then click 'Generate key pair'. Next, we need to copy the Public Key to the clipboard and use it in a moment. Keep the window open, we'll need to use the Private key later. Now let's go back to the 'Create a device' dashboard in Google. We need to create a name for our Device, this will be the 'Device ID'. Before we click 'CREATE' we need to click on the 'COMMUNICATION, CLOUD LOGGING, AUTENTICATION drop down. Here we'll paste the Public key we generated earlier. Make sure the Public key format is set to RS256. Then click on 'CREATE' button. Next we'll create a Gateway. From inside the Device details dashboard select 'Gateways' from the menu on the left. Click on the 'CREATE A GATEWAY' Next will name our Gateway, this will be the 'Gateway ID' that we will add to our code. Before we click 'CREATE', click on the 'COMMUNICATION, CLOUD LOGGING, AUTHENTICATION tab. We have to add the same Public key we pasted earlier here too. Make sure that the key format is also set to RS256. Then click on 'CREATE' button. Finally, lets bind our Device to the Gateway. Click on 'BOUND DEVICES' tab and then click on the 'BIND DEVICES' button. Select our Device from the list and click 'BIND' We have the data we need now let's plug in all the IDs we created into our code var projectId = \"sitcoreiot\"; var cloudRegion = \"us-central1\"; var registryId = \"SITCore-IoT-Registry\"; var deviceId = \"MySITCore\"; var gatewayId = \"SITCoreGatewayIoT\"; We need to add a Google Root CA Certificate to our resources and add it to this line of our code. var caCertSource = Resources.GetBytes(Resources.BinaryResources.\"GOOGLE Root CERT\"); Lastly when connect to google cloud, you also need a JWT (JSON Web Token) to be used as password if using MQTT. For an easy way to generate a JWT visit https://jwt.io/ . However, if you are concerned about sharing your private key with a third party site, there are a multitude of other options. Warning By using https://jwt.io/ , your private key is shared with a third-party. This should be used only for testing purpose.\" We must change the 'PAYLOAD DATA' to match the image above. There are two fields iat (issue at), and exp (expire), they contain time in Unix Timestamp format. You can convert them online at https://www.epochconverter.com/ { \"iat\": 1602616824, \"aud\": \"sitcoreiot\", \"exp\": 1602616858 } Finally copy your Endoded Token into this line of code in your program: var jwt = \"Paste your JWT here\"; Note The google cloud connection accepts a maximum expire time of 24 hours, meaning the timespan between iat and exp must be less than 24 hours. To receive a message from Google Cloud click on the 'SEND COMMAND' under the Gateway dashboard. Enter your message and click 'SEND' The device will receive your message and display it in the Output window of Visual Studio. To view the messages being sent from the device to the cloud we need to add a subscription to 'MyTopic'. To do this we need to go to the Registry dashboard and click on the topic we created called 'MyTopic' Once on the 'Pub/Sub' dashboard, select 'Subscriptions' from the side menu.

    "title": "General Purpose Input Output (GPIO)",
    "keywords": "General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) Microcontrollers include pins that can be controlled through software. They can be logical inputs or outputs, hence the name \"general purpose input/output\". Tip GPIO is found in the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio NuGet package and pin definitions are found in the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins package. Digital Outputs A digital output pin can be set to either high or low. High means that there is approx. 3.3V on the output pin. When the pin is set to low, it's voltage will be very close to zero. Warning Never connect two output pins together. If they are connected and one is high and the other is low, the entire processor can be damaged. Tip Digital pins on microcontrollers are weak. They can only be used to control small LEDs or drive transistors. Those transistors can, in turn, control devices with high power needs like a motor. var led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PH6); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); while (true) { led.Write(GpioPinValue.High); Thread.Sleep(100); led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); Thread.Sleep(100); } Digital Inputs Digital inputs sense the state of a pin based on its voltage. Minimum voltage on most pins is 0 volts; a negative voltage may damage the pin or the processor. Most processors run on 3.3V, the highest voltage a pin should see is 3.3V. However, some processors that are powered by 3.3V are 5V tolerant -- they can withstand up to 5V on their inputs. SITCore is 5V tolerant. Warning 5V tolerant doesn't mean the processor can be powered by 5V, only that the input pins can tolerate 5V. Unconnected input pins are called \"floating.\" A resistor can be added to pull the pin high or low. Modern processors include internal pull-up and pull-down resistors that are controlled by software. The code sample below uses an internal pull-up resistor to set the button high. When the button is pressed the GpioPinValue goes low. var gpio = GpioController.GetDefault(); var button = gpio.OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PD7); button.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.InputPullUp); while (true) { if (button.Read() == GpioPinValue.Low) { //Button is pressed. } Thread.Sleep(10); //Always give the system time to think! } Digital Input Events Using events to check an input instead of polling the input (using a loop) is often preferred. The following code demonstrates a GPIO pin event (interrupt) on the SCM20260D Dev board. You will see a reference to a \"falling edge\" in the following code. A falling edge occurs when the state of a pin goes from high to low. A rising edge is just the opposite -- it occurs when a pin goes from low to high. var gpio = GpioController.GetDefault(); var button = gpio.OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PD7); button.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.InputPullUp); button.ValueChangedEdge = GpioPinEdge.FallingEdge | GpioPinEdge.RisingEdge; button.ValueChanged += Button_ValueChanged; //Do other tasks here ... Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); void Button_ValueChanged(GpioPin sender, GpioPinValueChangedEventArgs e) { if (e.Edge == GpioPinEdge.FallingEdge) { // Pin went low } else { // Pin went high } } When a mechanical button is pressed it generates multiple edges that are caused by the contact physically bouncing. The built in debounce feature filters out any edges coming in faster than a specific time, which is set to 20ms be default. The debounce value can be changed using software. pin.DebounceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(10); SITCore Interrupt limitation Digital input events rely on internal GPIO interrupts to work. On SITCore, these interrupts are only available on 16 pins at any given time, the pin number must be unique, over all of the available ports. For example: PA1 and PB1 cannot both be used as interrupts at the same time. However, PA1 and PB2, or even PA1 and PA2, can be used simultaneously. Consider other internal system functions that need interrupts, such as WiFi. Those also reserve one of the 16 available interrupts. LowLevel Access For advanced users only , there is a ways to SetAlternate() function and also to control ReservePin() . The chip internally may support certain peripheral on more that one pin. We select default ones and those are the one that everyone must use and they are the ones listed in the official pinout. However, advanced users only have the option to move the peripheral, or one of pins on that peripheral, to an alternate pin. Warning This advanced feature does not check what alternate functions are valid. This example will move MOSI2 pin from PB2 to PC7, assuming AF6 // start by creating SPI2 to initialize the feature on PB2 // now transfer... var settings = new Settings {​​​​​​​ mode = PortMode.AlternateFunction, speed = OutputSpeed.VeryHigh, driveDirection = PullDirection.None, alternate = AlternateFunction.AF6, type = OutputType.PushPull }​​​​​​​; LowLevelController.TransferFeature(SC20100.GpioPin.PB2, SC20100.GpioPin.PC7, settings); SetAlternate() can not be called at will and must be called at a specific time. It must be called after creating the controller for CAN, DMCI, QSPI, SDcard, SPI, and I2C. When using PWM the function must be used after enabling the channel. Both UART & Native Display can be remapped after calling SetActiveSettings() ."

    "keywords": "I2C I2C (pronounced eye-squared-sea, or eye-two-sea) was originally developed by Phillips as a protocol for synchronous serial communication between integrated circuits. It has a master and one or more slaves sharing the same data bus. Instead of selecting the slaves by using a dedicated chip select signal like SPI, I2C uses an addressing mechanism to communicate with the selected device. This addressing method saves one I/O pin per slave. Before data is transferred, the master transmits the 7-bit address of the slave device it wants to communicate with. It also sends one bit indicating whether it wants to send data to the slave or receive data from the slave. When a slave sees its address on the bus, it will acknowledge its presence. At this point, the master can send or receive data. The master will start data transfers with a \"start condition\" before sending an address or data. The master ends the data transfer with a \"stop condition.\" The two wires for I2C communication are called the SDA and SCL lines. SDA stands for Serial Data, and SCL is Serial Clock. Note I2C bus speed can be either 100,000 bits/second (standard mode) or 400,000 bits/second (fast mode).

If This Then That (IFTTT) is a service allowing users to automate tasks by using simple conditional statements to create scripts or Applets (previously called \"recipes\"). Some similar platforms you might want to check out include Twilio , ThingSpeak , Yonomi , and Home Assistant . IFTTT can be used to respond to both events on websites and events from devices. Some uses include: Turn on the lights when you come home. Send a text message if rain is forecast. Turn on your lights if your Ring doorbell senses motion. Turn off your WiFi when you aren't home. Send you an e-mail when the New York Times publishes a new article in its science section. Automatically back up your smart phone photos to the cloud. Automate GitHub tasks. Get a text message whenever a Craigslist post matches your search. Notify you when the International Space Station passes overhead. Track when your company is mentioned on Twitter or Reddit. The possibilities are almost endless. Here we will take you step by step through the process using IFTTT to send an email notification of a button being pressed on a SITCore Dev Board. First we will set up an IFTTT account, then create and test the needed applets, and finally program the SITCore to trigger the IFTTT applet. Create an IFTTT Account Signing up for IFTTT is easy and they offer a free limited account, but it only allows up to 3 applets. Their paid service offers unlimited applet creation, queries, conditional logic and multiple actions -- just go to IFTTT.com and click on the Sign up button in the upper right hand corner of the screen. You can sign up using your Google or Facebook account, or use an e-mail address and password to sign in. IFTTT will usually offer to set up a sample connection right after you sign up -- just hit the \"X\" in the upper right corner to skip this step. Click on the Get more button under the message Start connecting your world to get started. Create the IFTTT Applets Two IFTTT applets will be needed for this project. An Email Applet will be send an email when a button is pushed. A Webhooks Applet will be used to receive an HTTP GET request from the FEZ when the temperature goes below ten degrees. Finally, an If This Then That Applet will call the Email Applet when triggered by the Webhooks Applet. Create the Webhooks Applet After signing up click on Create button in the top menu. You will then be presented with a screen that may seem to provide no option forward. Click on If This Add to get to the next step. Search for webhooks and click on that option. On the next screen click on the Connect button, then click on the Receive a web request box on the following screen. You will be prompted for an event name. Enter button_press and press the Create trigger button. Now click on +That . This will take us to the next step of choosing an action service -- in this case we will send an email. Create the Email Applet You should now be on the Choose action service screen. Search for email and then click on the email icon. Click on the Connect button on the next screen. You will be prompted for an email address to send notifications to. Type in the email address you would like to use and press the Send PIN button. Once you receive the email with your PIN, enter the PIN and hit the Connect button. Now click on the Send me an email box. You should now be on the Complete action fields screen. Click on the Create action button without making any changes. This will tell IFTTT to use the default method of constructing the subject line and body of the notification email. This will then take you back to the main If Then page. Click on continue Finally we're at the Review and finish screen. Click on the Finish button. Get Your Key Now we just have to get the key that is sent from the SITCore to trigger the event. You should now be at a screen with the text \"If Maker Event \"button_press\", then Send me an email at. . . Click on the Webhooks icon as shown below: Then click on the Documentation button near the upper right of the next screen. This will bring up a page with your unique key. Including this key in an HTTP GET or POST request to the IFTTT website will trigger your event. To test the IFTTT event, you can enter the following line into the address bar of your web brower (replace Your_Key_Here with your key) : https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/button_press/with/key/Your_Key_Here Setup the SITCore To setup the FEZ we will have to connect a temperature sensor and then program the FEZ to send the proper HTTP GET request when the temperature drops below 10 degrees. Connect the Temperature Sensor For this demo we programmed the FEZ to act as a temperature alarm, but the same principles can be applied to any sensor that can be connected to the FEZ. You can also test the program without any sensor at all - just call SendSmsAlert() to simulate an alarm condition. For our temperature sensor we used an NPN transistor (2N2222A) and an 8.2K resistor as they were sitting conveniently on my desk. They were wired as shown below. Power for the temperature sensor is controlled by GPIO pin A1. 3V3 could have been used, but by using a GPIO pin the sensor can be turned off between readings to reduce the effects of self heating. The transistor is wired with its base and collector connected together so it is acting as a diode. When a constant current passes through this diode the voltage drop is a linear function with a temperature coefficient of about two millivolts per degree celsius. While a series resistor does not provide a true constant current source, it will be plenty accurate for this demo. Programming the FEZ Start a new C# project.

    "title": "In-Field Update",
    "keywords": "In-Field Update TinyCLR OS allows for secure, encrypted, In-Field Update (IFU). Simply, the IFU feature buffers the new 'to-be-updated' application (and/or firmware) into RAM or FLASH. Once the entire application (or firmware) is buffered, the IFU will do a full security check before it updates the system. Having enough flash or RAM (typically external) is needed to buffer up the application and the firmware. The IFU service is started with var updater = new InFieldUpdate(QuadSpiController) when using external flash, or simply with var updater = new InFieldUpdate() when using RAM. It is important to note that the firmware application is buffered temporarily externally in its encrypted format, keeping security intact. All decrypted data is handled internally inside the chip, away from intruders! The IFU system supports data coming from any source. An update, for example, can come from a file, network, or even CAN bus! Loading an application requires a key, which is loaded using updater.LoadApplicationKey(appKey) and then the application can then be loaded in chunks using updater.LoadApplicationChunk(data, 0, count) . And similarly, the firmware can be loaded through updater.LoadFirmwareChunk(data, 0, count) . Internally, IFU keeps track of chunk count and size. The passed argument is for the user's provided data and not the internal chunk/data counters. In case of an error, the user can reset the internal chunk counters updater.ResetChunks() , which resets both application and firmware counters. Once the entire firmware or application chunks are loaded, they can be verified and a version number is returned back, or an exception is raised if the loaded firmware/application did not pass authentication. var firmwareVersion = updater.VerifyFirmware(); var applicationVersion = updater.VerifyApplication(); The system is now ready for flash and reset updater.FlashAndReset() . It is critical that the system is not reset or power is lost during reset. Depending on the application size, this can take a few seconds. A power loss will result in a nonfunctional device that needs to be manually update. Note When update uses external flash (QSPI) as temporary buffer, the block size must be 1K, 2K, 4K, 8K...etc. We recommend using 1K as the firmware and tca files are always multiple of 1K. Memory Requirements Firmware update needs to have a temp buffer that is the size of the firmware itself. For applications, the temporary buffer needs to be the size of the internal deployment, plus the external deployment if implemented, by \"extending deployment\". Systems with large external RAM will usually select RAM update. For systems without external RAM, an external QSPI flash becomes necessary. When external flash is used for buffering, IFU will overwrite the entire flash, minus the first 2MB and the area reserved for extending the application deployment area, as explained under External Flash on the External Memory page. A Tiny File System usage of the first 2MB of external flash will survive IFU even when useExternalFlash is enabled. Activity Pin As update can take a while, an activity pin can be enabled to help in determining when the update is finished. Using an LED as an indicator is an excellent example. var indicatorLed = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PB0); updater.ActivityPin = indicatorLed; Example Code Tip The application and the firmware are buffered in external memories in encrypted fashion and has no security implication, keeping IFU done securely. Warning Power interruption during FlashAndReset will cause the update to fail, requiring a manual update. The example below show how to use IFU, firmware and application data are loaded from SDCard. var qspiController = StorageController.FromName(SC20260.StorageController.QuadSpi); var indicatorPin = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC13048.GpioPin.PB5); var appKey = new byte[] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 }; // your key, assumming they are all zero as example. var updater = new InFieldUpdate(qspiController) { ActivityPin = indicatorPin }; var dataChunk = new byte[1 * 1024]; // must be multiple of 1K var filestreamApp = new FileStream(@\"A:\\your_app.tca\", FileMode.Open); var filestreamFw = new FileStream(@\"A:\\ghi_firmware.ghi\", FileMode.Open); // Buffer application var idxApp = 0; while (idxApp < filestreamApp.Length) { var count = filestreamApp.Read(dataChunk, 0, dataChunk.Length); idxApp += updater.LoadApplicationChunk(dataChunk, 0, count); } // Buffer firmware var idxFirmware = 0; while (idxFirmware < filestreamFw.Length) { var count = filestreamFw.Read(dataChunk, 0, dataChunk.Length); idxFirmware += updater.LoadFirmwareChunk(dataChunk, 0, count); } //Load key updater.LoadApplicationKey(appKey); Debug.WriteLine(\"Verifying application.... \"); Debug.WriteLine(\"Application version: \" + updater.VerifyApplication()); Debug.WriteLine(\"Verify firmware.... \"); Debug.WriteLine(\"Firmware version: \" + updater.VerifyFirmware()); // Flashing updater.FlashAndReset(); Tip Once FlashAndReset is called the system is locked till done and reset automatically. ApplicationUpdate When no external memories are present (Flash nor RAM) and standard IFU is not an options, the application (not firmware) can still be updated from a file located on SD card or USB memory. // Open a file stream to an application file on an SD card or USB memory // ... var updater = new ApplicationUpdate(filestream, appKey) var applicationVersion = updater.Verify(); updater.ActivityPin = indicatorPin; // optional updater.FlashAndReset(); IFU 2.0 to 2.1 Starting release 2.1, IFU is reworked to support complete firmware and application update using external flash (when available) or external RAM (when available). Unfortunately, using IFU to update from 2.0 to 2.1 is only possible if the deployment region was not extended to use external flash. A work around to update 2.0 to 2.1 is by updating 2.0 to a new 2.1 temporary application that does not use external flash. Once this temp application is loaded then the final application with external flash can be deployed. Firmware and Application Matching It is important that the loaded firmware is the same version expected by the application. It is usually best to update both when possible."

Securing Code By default, user's code is stored securely on the internal flash memory. It can only be reached by the USB or serial debug interfaces, which can be disabled using the TinyCLR Config utility program or using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.DeviceInformation.SetDebugInterface(DebugInterface.Disable) .

The current active debug interface can be read through GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.DeviceInformation.DebugInterface . The system supports extending the deployment region, where user's code/assemblies are stored, into external unsecured flash memory. To keep important data secure, the system supports Secure Assemblies . Those assemblies are loaded into the internal secure flash. To tag an assembly as secure, users must edit the AssemblyInfo.cs file in the Properties folder within the project's folder. Change the line [assembly: AssemblyConfiguration(\"\")] to [assembly: AssemblyConfiguration(\"secure\")] (the word \"secure\" is not case sensitive). During deployment Visual Studio will display an allocation table showing both the secure and unsecure assemblies and their address, a quick way to verify secure assemblies. This is found in the TinyCLR Device Deployment Visual Studio output window. The In-Field Update page covers the details on updating a locked system. Securing Data The entire system, including user's keys, cryptography, and everything else are stored on the internal RAM, accessible only by the system itself and the user's application. When external RAM is utilized, it is only there for the graphics engine. Having images stored in unsecure memory has very little security concerns, unless for example, a key is shown on one of the images. There is also a special UnmanagedBuffer class that allocates memory from Unmanaged Heap , where the user is aware and is in control of what to do with this unsecure buffer. If desired, designs that require large heaps of RAM for the entire application have the option to extend the heap to fully encapsulate the external memory, making the system data unsecure. However, external RAM (SDRAM) isn't probed easily like external flash (QSPI) even if used for extended heap, not secure in this case but more challenging to probe.

    "title": "Memory Management",
    "keywords": "Memory Management RAM Memory This memory type loses its contents when the system is turned off. The system uses this memory at runtime to quickly store and retrieve data. TinyCLR OS is a managed operating system -- objects in RAM are automatically tracked and freed as needed. The Garbage Collector (GC) runs when the system is low on available RAM, where it will look for unused objects and free the memory they occupy. You may also invoke the GC at any time using System.GC.Collect() . RAM is the main workspace for your application -- running out of memory will cause your application to fail. It is important to understand the memory needs of your application and to plan accordingly. When creating a buffer for a UART for example, use a reasonable size buffer that's large enough to handle your communication needs without being so large as to waste memory. RAM Memory Size The amount of free and used memory can be shown at runtime, which can be helpful for debugging and optimizing your application. var freeRam = GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.Memory.ManagedMemory.FreeBytes; var usedRam = GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.Memory.ManagedMemory.UsedBytes; Allocating Memory The TinyCLR OS Garbage Collector allocates and frees objects automatically on the heap. When the memory gets fragmented, the system will compact the heap. This is desired behavior, but this also creates a problem when sharing resource between TinyCLR OS and native drivers. In a more advanced application, a user may have a buffer that gets written from an interrupt routine. Assuming this is implemented in native code, we would need a buffer that always sits at a fixed address. Using var buffer = new byte[12] will not work as the garbage collector may move the buffer to compact the heap. A fixed location buffer can be allocated using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.Memory.ManagedMemory.Allocate() . Keep in mind that this is not managed memory anymore, and you are responsible for freeing this memory using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.Memory.ManagedMemory.Free() . Memory Allocation Cost Creating and disposing of objects is costly, especially when done in inner loops. The following code sends 10,000 bytes from an array over a network one byte at a time. for (int i=0; i<10000; i++) { var byteArray = new byte[1]; byteArray[0] = arrayData[i]; Network.SendByteArray(byteArray); } The code will work just fine, but as byteArray[] is created within the loop, 10,000 single element byte arrays will be created and disposed of. It is much more efficient to create the array only once. byte[] byteArray = new byte[1]; for (int i=0; i<10000; i++) { byteArray[0] = arrayData[i]; Network.SendByteArray(byteArray); } Disposing of Objects As TinyCLR OS is a managed system that monitors and frees resources, memory leaks are less of a concern than they are for unmanaged systems. However, there is still chance that issues can arise, especially in embedded systems where objects can be a combination of memory and other hardware. Take a GPIO pin for example. What happens when we no longer have a reference to a GPIO pin? Will the GC free the object? Will the pin change in state when the GC frees the pin? And finally, why would a pin (or any physical object) be left for the GC to decide how it should be freed? The answer is that we need to understand and track these resources manually. This example code will declare and initialize a GPIO pin in a function, causing the main program to lose control of the pin. The BadExample method uses the LED's GPIO pin, but it doesn't free it. class Program { static void Main() { BadExample(); //The following line will raise an exception: var led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20100.GpioPin.PE11); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); } static void BadExample() { var led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20100.GpioPin.PE11); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); led.Write(GpioPinValue.High); } } The next example will Dispose of the pin and the code will work; however, disposing the pin may take the pin back to its default state. There is no exact definition on what a piece of hardware (the GPIO pin in this example) does when disposed. class Program { static void Main() { GoodExample(); //This code will now work var led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20100.GpioPin.PE11); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); //... } static void GoodExample() { var led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20100.GpioPin.PE11); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); led.Write(GpioPinValue.High); //Free the pin, but this may cause the pin to revert to its default state. led.Dispose(); } } The following example shows the best way to handle the situation by moving the LED object declaration, so it is available and accessible to the entire class. class Program { static GpioPin led; //You can now use 'led' anywhere within 'Program' static void Main() { // Init the hardware led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20100.GpioPin.PE11); led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); Example(); led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low); } static void Example() { led.Write(GpioPinValue.High); } } Garbage Collection TinyCLR OS automatically disposes of objects that are no longer needed. Garbage collection eliminates the need to manage memory manually and reduces or eliminates some types of bugs. The act of garbage collection can temporarily reduce the responsiveness of your system, so it may be beneficial to actively manage garbage collection to improve real time response. Garbage collection will usually only run when there is a failed memory allocation, so by properly structuring your program you should be able to eliminate garbage collection or greatly reduce it. String operations are particularly troublesome in the creation of garbage as strings are immutable. To reduce garbage collection, minimize the use of dynamically allocated buffers and minimize allocations in routines that get called often by preallocating or using static objects. Minimize string manipulation. As strings are immutable, manipulating a string creates a new string and the old string becomes garbage. Using StringBuilder to manipulate strings may help reduce garbage generation. You can use System.GC.GetTotalMemory(true) to find out how much memory is being used. the \"true\" argument forces full garbage collection. Checking free memory often during program execution will let you know if the amount of free memory is decreasing and how quickly. System.Diagnostics.Debug.EnableGCMessages(true) can be used to make sure that garbage collection messages are sent out over the debug port. TinyCLR also supports unmanaged heap space. Unmanaged heap space can be used for large graphic buffers, for example. In unmanaged heap space, it is up to the programmer to make sure memory is correctly allocated and deallocated. Read more about unmanaged heap space here . Finalizers The Garbage Collector does a lot of work in the background. To keep the system running smoothly, some of this work is done when the system is idle, like running finalizers and compacting the heap. When the system running a tight loop with continuous allocations, there will be no idle time for the Garbage Collector to finish its tasks. In this case, it is possible to force the Garbage Collector to finish the tasks. System.GC.Collect(); System.GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers(); Battery Backed RAM SITCore devices support 4 KBytes of battery backed RAM. Details can be found in the Real Time Clock Tutorial . Flash Memory Flash memory does not lose its contents on power loss. There are special requirements to write to Flash, but you can read Flash just like RAM. When deploying a program, the TinyCLR Device Deployment window will show what is being loaded and how large it is. It will then show how much free Flash is still available. Assemblies deployed. There are 2,408,408 bytes left in the deployment area. Flash is not typically written to at runtime. The system will function even with no free available FLASH. Resources TinyCLR OS allows resources, like fonts and images, to be merged into the project as a resource and then deployed to the device's Flash. Those resources can then be fetched into RAM and used at runtime. The Resource tutorial has more details. Direct Access Writing to Flash (persistent storage) is supported securely through secure storage."

While you may not need a unique MAC address for internal testing, you will need to set a valid and unique MAC address before shipping your product. If you do not have access to an appropriate MAC address, you can either use an online MAC address generator, which is not ideal, or you can use a MAC address from an old computer or network card that is no longer used. Not having a unique MAC address can be a problem. If two devices with the same MAC address are present on the same local network subnet, neither device will be able to communicate properly. The WINC1500 WiFi module supported by SITCore devices ships with a manufacturer assigned unique MAC address. This address is used by default, although you can provide your own MAC address if desired. Secure Sockets TLS is natively support. See the TLS page for details. .NET Sockets TinyCLR OS's support of sockets is very similar to .NET socket support. Most .NET socket code should run with little modification. Socket support is provided as part of the TinyCLR OS core. Tiny CLR sockets work similar to .NET sockets -- most .NET examples are applicable to TinyCLR. TCP/UDP TCP and UDP are the core of the Internet protocols and are supported through standard .NET Sockets. The web is full of examples on using TCP and UDP Sockets that should work as is or with minor changes. TCP example: var s = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp)){ try { var ip = IPAddress.Parse(\"192.168.1.87\"); s.Connect(new IPEndPoint(ip, 80)); s.Send(System.Text.UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"I am SITCore\\n\\r\")); } catch { } } UDP example: var socket = new System.Net.Sockets.Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp); var ip = new IPAddress(new byte[] { 192, 168, 1, 87 }); var endPoint = new IPEndPoint(ip, 2000); socket.Connect(endPoint); byte[] bytesToSend = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(msg); while (true) { socket.SendTo(bytesToSend, bytesToSend.Length, SocketFlags.None, endPoint); while (socket.Poll(2000000, SelectMode.SelectRead)){ if (socket.Available > 0){ byte[] inBuf = new byte[socket.Available]; var recEndPoint = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 0); socket.ReceiveFrom(inBuf, ref recEndPoint); if (!recEndPoint.Equals(endPoint))// Check if the received packet is from the 192.168.0.2 continue; Debug.WriteLine(new String(Encoding.UTF8.GetChars(inBuf))); } } Thread.Sleep(100); } IP Assignment TinyCLR OS supports both static and dynamic IP addressing. With either method, an event is fired providing the local IP settings. networkController.NetworkAddressChanged += NetworkController_NetworkAddressChanged; // ... private static void NetworkController_NetworkAddressChanged (NetworkController sender, NetworkAddressChangedEventArgs e) { var ipProperties = sender.GetIPProperties(); } Tip Static IP addressing does not work with PPP . Static IP With static IP addressing, the following settings must be provided. networkInterfaceSetting.DhcpEnabled = false; networkInterfaceSetting.Address = new IPAddress(new byte[] { 192, 168, 1, 122 }); networkInterfaceSetting.SubnetMask = new IPAddress(new byte[] { 255, 255, 255, 0 }); networkInterfaceSetting.GatewayAddress = new IPAddress(new byte[] { 192, 168, 1, 1 }); networkInterfaceSetting.DnsAddresses = new IPAddress[] { new IPAddress(new byte[] { 75, 75, 75, 75 }), new IPAddress(new byte[] { 75, 75, 75, 76 }) }; Dynamic IP The following line of code enables dynamic IP, which start by trying to lease an IP from a DHCP server. If that fails, the system will self-assign an IP address through AutoIP mechanism. This can take a while but an event is fired when an IP is available. networkInterfaceSetting.DhcpEnabled = true; Tip AutoIP addresses always fall within the 169.254.x.x range to determine if an IP was generated using AutoIP DNS The TinyCLR Dns class can be used to resolve a URL into its IP address by using the following code: var hostEntry = Dns.GetHostEntry(hostName); if ((hostEntry != null) && (hostEntry.AddressList.Length > 0)) { var i = 0; while (hostEntry.AddressList[i] == null) i++; remoteIpAddress = hostEntry.AddressList[i]; } else { throw new Exception(\"Server not found.\"); ; } mDNS Multicast DNS is a local name resolution service over local networks. Please note that not all operating systems support mDNS. networkInterfaceSetting.MulticastDnsEnable = true; networkController.Enable(); MulticastDns.Start(\"MyServer\", TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1*60*60)); // TTL set to 1 hour"

Idle The system enters this state whenever it is idle, such as when waiting on events and there are no running threads. This is automatic and they user is not required to take any action. Slow Clock Speed The system can operate at half speed, saving about 40% power consumption. The system can switch speed (with a required soft reset) but it can optionally persist the slow clock. var PersistClock = false; if (Power.GetSystemClock() == SystemClock.High) { Power.SetSystemClock(SystemClock.Low, PersistClock); Power.Reset(); } Switch back to full speed (only if \"PersistClock\" was false): if (Power.GetSystemClock() == SystemClock.Low) { Power.SetSystemClock(SystemClock.High, false); Power.Reset(); } When not persisted, calling Power.Reset() will retain the set clock speed, but hardware reset (reset pin) or power cycle will revert to the default state.

To prevent the +++ escape sequence from being misinterpreted as data, the following guidelines should be followed: 1) Do not send any other characters within one second (before or after) of sending +++ . 2) Send +++ quickly, sending all three characters within one second. When the +++ sequence is received, the modem will switch from data mode to command mode and reply with an \"OK\" response. Switching to Data Mode When the modem is in command mode, sending the ATO command will switch the modem to Data Mode. Wait for the \"CONNECT 150000000\" response after sending the ATO command to make sure the modem is in data mode. All data sent will now be treated as PPP frames. The following example switches from Data mode to Command Mode, sends a few AT commands, then switches back to Data mode. TinyCLR OS provides two functions, Suspend() and Resume() that are needed for this example. This code uses SC20260.UartPort.Uart8 for PPP configuration. //PPP is connected //.... networkController.Suspend(); { //Suspend PPP, release UART Port from TinyCLR OS. //Open UART. var serial = GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Uart.UartController.FromName (SC20260.UartPort.Uart8); serial.SetActiveSettings( 115200, 8, GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Uart.UartParity.None, GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Uart.UartStopBitCount.One, GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Uart.UartHandshake.None); serial.Enable(); Thread.Sleep(1000); SendAT(serial, \"+++\"); //Send \"+++\" to enter command mode. Thread.Sleep(1000); //Send any AT command here. //For example, AT+CSQ to check signal strength. SendAT(serial, \"AT+CSQ\"); SendAT(serial, \"ATO\"); //Enable \"PPP\" modem, wait for \"CONNECT 150000000\" response. serial.Dispose(); serial = null; //Release UART, resume PPP interface. } networkController.Resume(); // Continue network ... Note When sending \"+++\", do not send \"\\r\" or \"\\n\" at the end. While most AT commands need end of line characters, +++ does not. Security Clarification Most users of embedded systems that connect to mobile networks assume they are secure, but often they are not. Typically, a serial connection with AT commands is used to communicate with the modem. While the data over the air is secure, all data transmitted over the serial connection is raw unencrypted data that can be easily scoped. This is not the case with TinyCLR OS. With TinyCLR OS, serial data between the device and the modem is encrypted. All data handling is done internally inside the core processor, which is extremely difficult to hack into."

    "title": "PWM",
    "keywords": "PWM Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a very useful feature found on most microcontrollers. PWM is a method of generating a square wave signal of uniform frequency with variable duty cycle. PWM is often used to generate analog voltages, but has many other uses such as generating digital pulses for driving servo motors or driving infrared LEDs for communication. The ratio of the pulse width to it's period is called the duty cycle. Through software, you can control both the PWM frequency and duty cycle. Tip We usually use GetDefault() for most peripherals. For example, there is only one GPIO controller on most systems. This is not the case with PWM. Never use the Default controller and always select the proper channel on the corresponding controller. Tip PWM2.3 is channel 3 on controller 2. Energy Level PWM is perfect for dimming an LED or controlling the speed of a motor. When the duty cycle is 50%, half the energy is transferred to the attached load. var controller = PwmController.FromName(SC20260.Timer.Pwm.Controller3.Id); var led = controller.OpenChannel(SC20260.Timer.Pwm.Controller3.PB0); controller.SetDesiredFrequency(10000); double duty = 0.5, speed = 0.01; led.Start(); while (true) { if (duty <= 0 || duty >= 1.0) { speed *= -1; //Reverse direction. duty += speed; } led.SetActiveDutyCyclePercentage(duty); duty += speed; Thread.Sleep(10); //Always give the system time to think! } Musical Tones Musical notes have specific frequencies; C for example is about 261Hz. Plugging these numbers into an array and knowing the length of each tone is all that is needed to play some simple music. When playing notes by changing the frequency, keep the duty cycle set to 0.5. The following example is written for the SC20100S Dev Board. using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Pwm; using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins; using System.Threading; class Program { const int NOTE_C = 261; const int NOTE_D = 294; const int NOTE_E = 330; const int NOTE_F = 349; const int NOTE_G = 392; const int WHOLE_DURATION = 2000; const int EIGHTH = WHOLE_DURATION / 8; const int QUARTER = WHOLE_DURATION / 4; const int QUARTERDOT = WHOLE_DURATION / 3; const int HALF = WHOLE_DURATION / 2; const int WHOLE = WHOLE_DURATION; //Make sure the two below arrays match in length.

However, hardware-PWM only worked on specific pins. TinyCLR supports PWM on any pin, generated by software. While software PWM is not very accurate and requires constant processor time to generate the signal, it works well at lower frequencies. This is good for dimming lights or driving servos. var softwarePwmController = PwmController.FromName(SC20260.Timer.Pwm.Software.Id); var pwmPinPB3 = softwarePwmController.OpenChannel(SC20260.GpioPin.PB3); softwarePwmController.SetDesiredFrequency(1000); // set frequency 1KHz pwmPinPB3.SetActiveDutyCyclePercentage(0.5); pwmPinPB3.Start(); Thread.Sleep(10 * 1000); //Delay 10 second pwmPinPB3.Stop(); Tip On SITCore, the range the range of PWM frequency is 15.4Hz to 10KHz. Servo Motors Servo motors use PWM to generate the necessary signal. A NuGet package is provided to simplify the use of servos. The example below uses the software PWM feature, allowing any digital pin to be used. Hardware PWM can be used as well. Tip As a rule, servos have three wires. Be sure the central wire is connected to 5V. The lighter color wire on one side of the connector is a signal and should be connected to a PWM pin. The third one, which is usually a darker color, is ground.

It needs its own crystal and keeps running even when the main system and its clocks are powered off. In the event the RTC battery was drained or the RTC was never initialized, the RTC will not have a correct value. Use the rtc.IsValid method to determine if the time was set correctly.

This is usually what is recommended as it provides an accurate time. If crystal is not available, the RTC will fall back and run using an internal RC. The internal RC is not as accurate as an external crystal and temperature will skew the time. VBAT VBAT mode can be set in \"charger mode\" where it can charge an attached a supercap. Typically, VBAT requires 1.2 to 3.6 volts for correct operation. Important Make sure the RTC battery charge mode is correctly set. Charging a lithium coin cell may cause damage to the cell and could cause it to leak. Not charging a supercap will result in a discharged supercap and loss of correct time and battery backed ram data when your board is powered down. var rtc = GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Rtc.RtcController.GetDefault(); //The following line turns off charging.

The system clock starts running at power up, but until you set the clock, the time and date will be incorrect. The following command is used to set the time: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.SystemTime.SetTime(DateTime utcTime); To set the system clock to the RTC time, use the following command: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Native.SystemTime.SetTime(rtc.Now); SNTP You can use SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) to accurately set the time in your application. The following method will return the current date and time after retrieving it from an NTP server. Your device will need an active network connection for this code to work. public static DateTime GetNetworkTime(int CorrectLocalTime = 0) { const string ntpServer = \"pool.ntp.org\"; var ntpData = new byte[48]; ntpData[0] = 0x1B; //LeapIndicator = 0 (no warning), VersionNum = 3 (IPv4 only), // Mode = 3 (Client Mode) var addresses = System.Net.Dns.GetHostEntry(ntpServer).AddressList; var ipEndPoint = new System.Net.IPEndPoint(addresses[0], 123); var socket = new System.Net.Sockets.Socket( System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily.InterNetwork, System.Net.Sockets.SocketType.Dgram, System.Net.Sockets.ProtocolType.Udp); socket.Connect(ipEndPoint); System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1); //Added to support TinyCLR OS. socket.Send(ntpData); socket.Receive(ntpData); socket.Close(); ulong intPart = (ulong)ntpData[40] << 24 | (ulong)ntpData[41] << 16 | (ulong)ntpData[42] << 8 | (ulong)ntpData[43]; ulong fractPart = (ulong)ntpData[44] << 24 | (ulong)ntpData[45] << 16 | (ulong)ntpData[46] << 8 | (ulong)ntpData[47]; var milliseconds = (intPart * 1000) + ((fractPart * 1000) / 0x100000000L); var networkDateTime = (new System.DateTime(1900, 1, 1)). AddMilliseconds((long)milliseconds); return networkDateTime.AddHours(CorrectLocalTime); } The above method is used as follows, with the argument indicating how many hours to add to convert UTC time to your local time zone: DateTime dateTime = GetNetworkTime(-5); Battery Backed Memory SITCore devices include 4 KBytes of battery backed memory. This memory accepts and returns byte arrays of data. The commands and their overloads for accessing this memory are as follows: BackupMemorySize; //Returns 4096, total size in bytes of battery backed memory. ReadBackupMemory(byte[] destinationData); ReadBackupMemory(byte[] destinationData, uint sourceOffset); ReadBackupMemory(byte[] destinationData, uint destinationOffset, uint sourceOffset, int count); public void WriteBackupMemory(byte[] sourceData, uint destinationOffset); public void WriteBackupMemory(byte[] sourceData); public void WriteBackupMemory(byte[] sourceData, uint sourceOffset, uint destinationOffset, int count); Note that the battery backed memory is not managed at all. There is no allocate, dispose, or garbage collection. The commands used to access battery backed memory only copy the bytes from your array into memory, or from memory into your array. Until you overwrite it or lose RTC battery power, the data will always be in battery backed memory. Here is a simple example that displays the size of the battery backed memory, and then writes and reads five bytes of data. Tip Needed NuGet: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Rtc var rtc = RtcController.GetDefault(); Debug.WriteLine(rtc.BackupMemorySize.ToString()); //Displays \"4096\" var writeData = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; rtc.WriteBackupMemory(writeData); var readData = new byte[5]; rtc.ReadBackupMemory(readData); for (int i=0; i < 5; i++) { Debug.WriteLine(readData[i].ToString()); //Displays 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } RTC Calibration RTC also provides a calibration feature. rtc.Calibrate(int pulse); pulse is how many ticks to add (positive) or remove (negative) every 32 seconds. Use 0 to disable. Maximum pulse is +/-512, meaning RTC frequency can be adjust between -487.1ppm to 488.5ppm."

    "title": "Signal Control",
    "keywords": "Signal Control DigitalSignal The DigitalSignal is used to handle digital signals! Unlike the other features on this page, DigitalSignal is accurate because it is hardware-backed and runs in a non-blocking manner. Being hardware backed, this feature only runs on specific pins. Those pins can be found under the pins library, under `SC20260.Timer.DigitalSignal.Controller?.xxx. Tip Timers are also used with other features, such as PWM. Once a Timer is reserved for DigitalSignal, it is no longer available for other features. There are two uses for DigitalSignal, reading a signal (capture) and sending a signal (generate). The capture feature also support capturing a stream of durations (signal analyzer) or a pulse counter. Generate Using the Generate function allows the user to create a very accurate signal generator. Generate(uint[]data, uint offset, uint count) data is the length of each pulse in ticks. By default, each tick is 100ns. There is a limitation to the data being used: The data array length is limited to 64K elements. Also, adding individual elements together in the array can also not exceed 0xFFFFFFFF in total. Generate(uint[]data, uint offset, uint count, unit multiplier) Depends on the devices, allowable multiplier values range are different: On SC20xxx, allowable multiplier values range from 25 to 250,000 (250us). There are also 2 rules to the allowed values: 1,000,000,000 % multiplier must result in zero and 240,000,000 (240MHz) % (1,000,000,000 / multiplier) must also be zero. There is no different between full speed and half speed because clock source is 240MHz always. On SC13xxx, allowable multiplier values range from 25 to 800,000 (800us). There are also 2 rules to the allowed values: 1,000,000,000 % multiplier must result in zero and 80,000,000 (80MHz) % (1,000,000,000 / multiplier) must also be zero. When device run at half speed, the clock source is 40MHz, and max ranges is 25 to 1,600,000 (1.6ms); The signal generator always start with a signal at low level. It then toggles the signal every x time. The time is fetched from the array given, one by one. Note that by sending an even count of pulses, teh signal will terminate with a high-level as shown below. Starting a second write will cause the signal to first go low, which may not be desired, as it causes an extra pulse on the next Generate . This pulse has a variable with. Making sure that the data Length is always an odd number will assure that the signal will terminate at a low-level. Tip Software-generated SignalGenerator below gives more flexibility but runs in system blocking mode. While SignalGenerator is all Hardware-driven making it very accurate, non-blocking and it does not use processor time. Calling Generate will return immediately (non-blocking) allowing the system to do other tasks while the signal is being generated in the background. When the signal is generated completely, an event is fired. To aid in signal handling, the event provides the final resting level of the signal. OnGenerateFinished => OnGenerateFinished; dsig.OnGenerateFinished += (a, b) => { if (b == GpioPinValue.High) Debug.WriteLine(\"Write done, end state high\"); else Debug.WriteLine(\"Write done, end state low\"); }; Capture The Capture feature returns an array of timestamps of individual durations. The returned values are in nanoseconds. Tip Digital Signal is limited to the timer max value, which comes to be about 17.89 seconds. The waitForEdge helps by only starting the timer when there is an active pulse. var digitalSignalPin = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20260.Timer.Capture.Controller5.PB3); var digitalSignal = new DigitalSignal(digitalSignalPin); bool waitForEdge = false;// Start capturing as soon as Capture is called // Subscribe event when done capturing digitalSignal.OnCaptureFinished += Digital_OnCaptureFinished; // start capture 100 samples, timeout is 15seconds digitalSignal.Capture(100, GpioPinEdge.RisingEdge | GpioPinEdge.FallingEdge, waitForEdge, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15)); // Wait for finish capture // do other work Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); // The event private static void Digital_OnCaptureFinished(DigitalSignal sender, uint[] buffer, uint count, GpioPinValue pinValue) { if (count == 0) { Debug.WriteLine(\"no data was captured!\"); return; } for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) { Debug.WriteLine(\"Sample [\" + i +\"]: \"+ buffer[i]+\" ns\"); } } Note The first captured pulse will likely have an inaccurate (shorter) value due to system prep-time. ReadPulse ReadPulse can be used to measure frequency and other analyses that require measuring time duration for specific pulse count. var digitalSignalPin = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20260.Timer.Capture.Controller5.PB3); var digitalSignal = new DigitalSignal(digitalSignalPin); bool waitForEdge = true;// wait for first pulse before starting the measurement // Subscribe event when done reading digitalSignal.OnReadPulseFinished += Digital_OnReadPulseFinished; // Start reading 1000 pulses digitalSignal.ReadPulse(1000, GpioPinEdge.RisingEdge, waitForEdge); // do other work... Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); // the event void Digital_OnReadPulseFinished(DigitalSignal sender, TimeSpan duration, uint count, GpioPinValue pinValue) { var ticks = duration.Ticks; var microsecond = ((double)duration.Ticks) / 10; var millisecond = ((double)duration.Ticks) / 10000; var freq = (count / microsecond) * 1000000; Debug.WriteLine(\"GpioPinValue = \" + ((pinValue == GpioPinValue.High) ? \"High\" : \"Low\")); Debug.WriteLine(\"PulseCount = \" + count); Debug.WriteLine(\"Duration ticks = \" + ticks); Debug.WriteLine(\"Duration microsecond = \" + microsecond); Debug.WriteLine(\"Duration millisecond = \" + millisecond); Debug.WriteLine(\"freq = \" + freq / 1000.0 + \" KHz\"); } Abort An event is fired when any DigitalSignal operation is completed. In some cases, it may be desired to terminate the operation early, using Abort . When aborted, an event is still triggered, which will contain whatever data/pulses was collected from the trigger to the time Abort was called. var digitalSignalPin = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20260.Timer.Capture.Controller5.PB3); var digitalSignal = new DigitalSignal(digitalSignalPin); var waitForEdge = false; digitalSignal.OnReadPulseFinished += Digital_OnReadPulseFinished while (true) { if (digitalSignal.CanReadPulse) { digitalSignal.ReadPulse(1000, GpioPinEdge.RisingEdge, waitForEdge); Thread.Sleep(1000); digitalSignal.Abort(); Debug.WriteLine(\"Aborted\"); } } void Digital_OnReadPulseFinished(DigitalSignal sender, TimeSpan duration, uint count, GpioPinValue pinValue) { if (count > 0) { var microsecond = ((double)duration.Ticks) / 10; var freq = (count / microsecond) * 1000000; Debug.WriteLine(\"freq = \" + freq / 1000.0 + \" KHz\"); } else { Debug.WriteLine(\"No clock found.\"); } } Tip In the sample code above you can use PWM to provide the pulse needed to verify the code. Keep in mind that both PWM and DigitalSignal share resources, so a different Timer controller must be used. Pulse Feedback The PulseFeedback class can be used in three different modes. These modes are used to measure Echo Duration, Duration Until Echo, and Drain Duration. Echo Duration Echo Duration sends a trigger pulse of a given state over the provided pin. It then waits for an echo on the other specified pin and measures the length of that echo pulse. The trigger and echo pins cannot be the same pin. The following code will read the distance in centimeters from an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor. This sensor has a trigger pin that is pulsed high to start distance measurement. It has a separate echo pin that the sensor holds high until it receives an echo. Therefore, the time the echo pin is high represents the time it takes for the sound to hit the target and reflect back to the sensor. To test this code, I plugged the sensor directly into the SCM20260D Dev board and ran a couple short wires for power. It was convenient having 5V on the header. I was surprised how well this inexpensive sensor worked. Note The HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor requires a 5 volt power supply. While the module accepts 3.3 volt logic on the Trig and Echo pins, it will not work with a 3.3 volt supply for power. var gpio = GpioController.GetDefault(); var distanceTriggerPin = gpio.OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PA15); var distanceEchoPin = gpio.OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PJ14); pulseFeedback = new PulseFeedback(distanceTriggerPin, distanceEchoPin, PulseFeedbackMode.EchoDuration) { DisableInterrupts = false, Timeout = System.TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), PulseLength = System.TimeSpan.FromTicks(100), EchoValue = GpioPinValue.High, PulseValue = GpioPinValue.High, }; while (true) { var time = pulseFeedback.Trigger(); var microseconds = time.TotalMilliseconds * 1000.0; var distance = microseconds * 0.036 / 2.0; Debug.WriteLine(distance.ToString()); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } Duration Until Echo Duration Until Echo is very similar to Echo Duration, although instead of sending a pulse and measuring the length of the resulting echo, it measures how long it takes until that echo is received. Pulse and echo cannot use the same pins. The following code reads the distance in centimeters from a Polaroid 6500 Ranging Module. This module is similar to the HC-SR04 distance sensor, however the time it takes for the sensor to pulse the ECHO pin after your device pulses the INIT must be measured. Tip Needed Nuget: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Signals` var gpio = GpioController.GetDefault(); var distanceTriggerPin = gpio.OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PA15); var distanceEchoPin = gpio.OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PJ14); var pulseFeedback = new PulseFeedback(distanceTriggerPin, distanceEchoPin, PulseFeedbackMode.DurationUntilEcho) { DisableInterrupts = false, Timeout = System.TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), PulseLength = System.TimeSpan.FromTicks(100), EchoValue = GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio.GpioPinValue.High, PulseValue = GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio.GpioPinValue.High, }; while (true) { var time = pulseFeedback.Trigger(); var microseconds = time.TotalMilliseconds * 1000.0; var distance = microseconds * 0.036 / 2.0; Debug.WriteLine(distance.ToString()); Thread.Sleep(1000); } Drain Duration In this DrainDuration mode is used to implement capacitive touch. When calling Trigger, the pulse line will be held in the specified state for the specified time and then set to an input. It then measures the time for the pin to change its state. Only the pulse line is used in this mode. Echo pin is ignored. The image below shows a sample circuit. Note that this mode can only be used with a single pin. The following example illustrates the reading of a capacitive touch sensor. It sends a pulse of 10us to charge a capacitor and then measures the length of time it takes the capacitor to discharge on the same pin. It prints out the total discharge duration in milliseconds. It repeats every second. var gpio = GpioController.GetDefault(); var capacitiveSensePin = gpio.OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PJ14); var pulseFeedback = new PulseFeedback(capacitiveSensePin, PulseFeedbackMode.DrainDuration) { DisableInterrupts = false, Timeout = System.TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), PulseLength = System.TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1), PulseValue = GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio.GpioPinValue.High, }; while (true) { Debug.WriteLine(pulseFeedback.Trigger().TotalMilliseconds.ToString()); Thread.Sleep(1000); } Signal Capture The SignalCapture class monitors a pin and records any changes (high-low or low-high transitions) of the pin to an array. It is a digital waveform recorder. Each array element is the number of microseconds between each signal change. When calling Read, it blocks other code from executing until it either fills the input buffer or it has captured the number of transitions specified by the count argument. If your signal is shorter than that, the call will never return. Make sure to request only what you plan to capture. The following sample code captures the signal generated by pressing LDR button on the SC20100S Dev board. It will attempt to capture 100 transitions, waiting no more than 10 seconds. It will also enable the pull-up resistor on the pin. It will return the initial state of the pin when it started capturing and how many transitions it captured. Note that the signal capture may record button bounces, resulting in a number of transitions in rapid succession. var gpio = GpioController.GetDefault(); var capturePin = gpio.OpenPin(SC20100.GpioPin.PE3); var capture = new SignalCapture(capturePin); var buffer = new TimeSpan[100]; capture.DisableInterrupts = false; capture.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10); capture.DriveMode = GpioPinDriveMode.InputPullUp; while (true) { var count = capture.Read(out var init, buffer); Thread.Sleep(100); } Signal Generator SignalGenerator is a digital waveform generator. SignalGenerator works by comparing an internal counter to an array of time values, one by one. When the value of the argument matches the counter, the output pin is changed. The time values are in microseconds. SignalGenerator can also be used to generate PWM. Unlike the PWM class, SignalGenerator can be used to generate PWM on any available output pin. It does use processor time -- the higher the frequency the more processor time it uses. At this time, SignalGenerator only operates in blocking mode. While SignalGenerator is running, it will not yield any processor time to other code. The following sample code will blink the user LED on the SC20100S Dev board four times (for one second each time) every five seconds. var gpio = GpioController.GetDefault(); var signalPin = gpio.OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PE11); var signalGen = new SignalGenerator(signalPin); var buffer = new[] { TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), }; signalGen.DisableInterrupts = false; signalGen.IdleValue = GpioPinValue.Low; while (true) { signalGen.Write(buffer); Thread.Sleep(5000); }"

    "keywords": "SPI SPI uses three or four wires for transferring data. A SPI bus consists of a single master and one or more slaves. The master will send the clock signal to the slaves over the SCK (Serial Clock) pin. It will also send data over MOSI (Master Out Slave In) pin, while reading incoming data on the MISO (Master In Slave Out) pin. The SCK line is used to determine how fast the data is moved. If you know electronics, this is simply a shift register. The master selects which slave it will swap the data with using the SSEL (Slave SELect) pin, sometimes called CS (Chip Select). In its simplest terms, the master will swap data between itself and the slave. You cannot write data without reading data at the same time. However, often you want to write data and don't care about the incoming data. To do this you can use the Write method. Keep in mind that the Write method is discarding whatever data the slave is sending back. Tip Note that a board running TinyCLR OS is always the SPI master, not the slave. In TinyCLR OS, SPI transfers are dynamically sent in batches that are internally optimized to allow for maximum speed back-to-back transfers. This is helpful when sending large buffers, such as when refreshing displays. Tip Some SPI devices (slaves) can have more than one select pin, like the VS1053 MP3 decoder chip that uses one select pin for data and the other for commands. Both share the three data transfer pins (SCK, MOSI, MISO). var cs = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PE4); var settings = new SpiConnectionSettings() { ChipSelectType = SpiChipSelectType.Gpio, ChipSelectLine = cs, Mode = SpiMode.Mode1, ClockFrequency = 4_000_000, }; var controller = SpiController.FromName(SC20100.SpiBus.Spi4); var device = controller.GetDevice(settings); device.Write(new byte[] { 1, 2 }); //Write something. device.TransferSequential(...); //This is good for reading registers. device.TransferFullDuplex(...); //This is the only one that truly represents how SPI works. SPI Clock Speed SITCore SPI controllers support different clock ranges. SPI Controllers 1, 2 & 3 4 & 5 6 Minimum Speed 188 kHz 469 kHz 250K Maximum Speed 24 MHz 60 MHz 32MHz Note Supported clock speeds are derived/divisible from the Maximum clock frequency. If the requested clock is not divisible, the next lower frequency will be used. This is to keep the clock speed as high as possible, but still at or below the requested speed. For example, on 60Mhz clock, the available options are 60Mhz, 30Mhz, 20Mhz, 15Mhz...etc. If the desired frequency is set to 29Mhz then 20Mhz will be used. The MinClockFrequency and MaxClockFrequency fields can be used at runtime. var controller = SpiController.FromName(SC20100.SpiBus.Spi3); Debug.WriteLine(controller.MinClockFrequency.ToString()); Debug.WriteLine(controller.MaxClockFrequency.ToString()); Bit Ordering TinyCLR supports switching between sending the most significant bit first (MSb) or least significant bit first (LSb). var spiSettings = new SpiConnectionSettings() { DataFrameFormat = SpiDataFrame.MsbFirst // MSb }; var spiSettings = new SpiConnectionSettings() { DataFrameFormat = SpiDataFrame.LsbFirst // LSb }; Software SPI Users have the option to drive (bit bang) SPI bus in software over any of the available GPIOs. var provider = new GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices. Spi.Provider.SpiControllerSoftwareProvider(mosi, miso, clk); Tip Software generated buses are slower and use more resources, but can be used on any pins. SPI Display Helper When partially updating a section of the SPI display, SPI includes a Write method to extract and send the needed data. Partial updates are faster than updating the full screen due to sending fewer bytes over SPI bus. var x = 10; var y = 20; var width = 100; var height = 100; var originalWidth = 160; spi.Write(graphicsBuffer, x, y, width, height, originalWidth, 1, 1); Tip Software SPI doesn't support this method. Pixel Multiplier This feature allows pixels to be multiplied across the screen, allowing larger displays to be used with lesser memory. For example, a 320x240 display can be used with 160x120 graphics buffer if both multipliers, the column and the row, are set to 2. The system will be able to drive the display with only 25% of the needed memory, trading off the resolution. Tip The column and row multipliers are independent from each other. A 320x240 display can be driven with a 320x120 graphics when column multiplier is set to 1 and the row multiplier is set to 2. spi.Write(buffer, x, y, width, height, originalWidth, columnMultiplier, rowMultiplier); Tip Software SPI doesn't support this feature."

The difference is that a thread that contains a one second sleep will delay for that one second in addition to the time used by other code in the thread. So, if a thread needs 0.5 second to complete what it is doing, sleeping for one second will cause the thread to execute every 1.5 seconds. This also gets more complex as a thread's code can have different processing time in every loop. A timer set to invoke a method every second will do so every second regardless of how long the invoked method takes to execute. However, care must be taken, because if a timer calls a method every 100 milliseconds, but the method needs more than 100 milliseconds to execute, you will end up flooding the system. The best practice is for timers to invoke methods that execute in a very short time."

    "title": "Touch Screen",
    "keywords": "Touch Screen Introduction Displays may optionally include a touch sensitive screen to detect user touch input. Touch Screens can be resistive or capacitive. Resistive Touch A resistive touch screen measures the resistance across the X and Y axes to determine the touch position. While it is possible to use GPIO and ADC, it is better to use dedicated chips. The only advantage of resistive touch over capacitive is that resistive touch works through a change in resistance induced by finger pressure, meaning you can use it while wearing gloves. However, resistive touch is not very accurate and requires calibration. Unless you have specific reason to use resistive touch, capacitive touch is preferred. The NuGet package GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Drivers.Touch.ResistiveTouch simplifies the process of adding resistive touch to a project. The code example below details how it is used. var touch = new ResistiveTouchController( 320, // Screen width 240, // Screen height SC20260.GpioPin.PA0, // digital pin support analog SC20260.GpioPin.PA3, // digital pin support analog SC20260.GpioPin.PA5, // digital pin SC20260.GpioPin.PC3, // digital pin SC20260.Adc.Controller1.Id, // Analog controller id SC20260.Adc.Controller1.PA0, // analog channel id SC20260.Adc.Controller1.PA3 // analog channel id ); touch.ScaleX = new Scale(20, 280); // option to get more accurate point touch.ScaleY = new Scale(20, 200); // option to get more accurate point while (true) { Thread.Sleep(100); // poll interval every 100ms var x = touch.X; var y = touch.Y; if (x >= 0 && y >= 0) // detected touch Debug.WriteLine(\"X: \" + x +\", Y = \" + y); } Capacitive Touch Capacitive touch screens are used on most modern devices, including phones. They are very accurate and capable of detecting multiple simultaneous touches. A special capacitive controller chip must be used to read the touch panel. This chip is usually mounted right on the flat cable going to the touch panel. These chips are usually I2C or SPI, with I2C being more common. The capacitive displays used in our development options use a touch controller from FocalTech. We provide the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Drivers.FocalTech.FT5xx6 NuGet package to interact with capacitive touch screens. The constructor simply needs to know which I2C bus and reset pin are being used. The event fires giving the exact position using display pixels as units -- there is no need for scaling or calibration. The driver source code is found on the TinyCLR Drivers repo . This simple example will draw a dot on touch move: using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Drivers.FocalTech.FT5xx6; var touch = new FT5xx6Controller( i2cController.GetDevice(FT5xx6Controller.GetConnectionSettings()), gpioController.OpenPin(SC20260.GpioPin.PJ14)); touch.Orientation = FT5xx6Controller.TouchOrientation.Degrees0; //Rotate touch coordinates. touch.TouchMove += (_, e) => { screen.FillEllipse(brush, e.X, e.Y, 5, 5); screen.Flush(); };"

    "title": "UART",
    "keywords": "UART Serial data ports, called UARTs, transfer data between devices using two pins: TXD (transmit data) and RXD (receive data). UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter. Asynchronous means there is no clock signal to synchronize the two devices. The devices agree on a data rate, called the baud rate, and send a start bit the beginning of each transmitted character to keep the devices synchronized. Some of the UARTs also have additional pins (RTS and CTS) to control data flow. These pins are only activated when Handshaking = UartHandshake.RequestToSend . Tip the TXD on one end (output) goes to the RXD on the other side (input) and vice versa. Tip UART ports are also referred to as COM ports, especially on PCs.. The easiest way to test a UART is by wiring a device's TXD to its RXD so any transmitted data is received by the same device. This is called a \"loopback\" test. The following code performs a simple loopback test. Tip UART requires the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Uart NuGet package. var txBuffer = new byte[] { 0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44, 0x45, 0x46 }; //A, B, C, D, E, F var rxBuffer = new byte[txBuffer.Length]; var myUart = UartController.FromName(SC20100.UartPort.Uart7); var uartSetting = new UartSetting() { BaudRate = 115200, DataBits = 8, Parity = UartParity.None, StopBits = UartStopBitCount.One, Handshaking = UartHandshake.None, }; myUart.SetActiveSettings(uartSetting); myUart.Enable(); myUart.Write(txBuffer, 0, txBuffer.Length); while (true) { if (myUart.BytesToRead > 0) { var bytesReceived = myUart.Read(rxBuffer, 0, myUart.BytesToRead); Debug.WriteLine(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(rxBuffer, 0, bytesReceived)); } Thread.Sleep(20); } RS485 and Driver Enable Transceivers, such as RS485, may require a DE (Driver Enable) pin. On SITCore, DE pin is same pin as RTS. The UART settings can be used to enable this feature through EnableDePin and InvertDePolarity . RS232 UART uses the processor's voltage levels (logic levels) for transferring data. On the SITCore this is 0 to 3.3 volts. In the early days of computers, UARTs used -12 to +12 volts to communicate reliably over longer distances. This is known as the RS232 standard. Some PCs still include serial ports, but those are RS232 serial ports. A voltage level shifter is needed to properly connect a logic level UART to an RS232 device. Warning Connecting your device to an RS232 port without a proper voltage level shifter can damage your device. Break Generation It is sometimes necessary to generate a break signal before transmission to let the receiver(s) know that a new data frame is starting. Such is the case when using the DMX protocol, which is often used for stage lighting. Note The previous transmission must finish before starting a new transmission that incorporates a break signal. The following code sample shows how to transmit an array of bytes using the DMX protocol: GpioPin dmxEnablePin = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(SC20100.GpioPin.PA1); dmxEnablePin.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output); dmxEnablePin.Write(GpioPinValue.High); var uart = UartController.FromName(SC20100.UartPort.Uart5); uart.SetActiveSettings(new UartSetting { DataBits = 8, StopBits = UartStopBitCount.Two, BaudRate = 250000 }); uart.Enable(); var txBuffer = new byte[] { 0, 127, 255, 255, 255 }; while (uart.BytesToWrite > 0) Thread.Sleep(0); //Make sure UART is done transmitting. //The following line sends a break of 100 uS before sending the data. uart.Write(txBuffer, 0, txBuffer.Length, TimeSpan.FromTicks(1000)); Event Handlers TinyCLR's UART API included the following event listeners: ClearToSendChanged DataReceived ErrorReceived txBuffer = new byte[] { 0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44, 0x45, 0x46 }; //A, B, C, D, E, F rxBuffer = new byte[txBuffer.Length]; myUart = UartController.FromName(SC20100.UartPort.Uart7); var uartSetting = new UartSetting() { BaudRate = 115200, DataBits = 8, Parity = UartParity.None, StopBits = UartStopBitCount.One, Handshaking = UartHandshake.None, }; myUart.SetActiveSettings(uartSetting); myUart.Enable(); myUart.DataReceived += MyUart_DataReceived; myUart.Write(txBuffer, 0, txBuffer.Length); Thread.Sleep(-1); void MyUart_DataReceived(UartController sender, DataReceivedEventArgs e) { var bytesReceived = myUart.Read(rxBuffer, 0, e.Count); Debug.WriteLine(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(rxBuffer, 0, bytesReceived)); } Tip Once you type += after the event, hit the tab key and Visual Studio will automatically create the event for you."

The keys used can be Press , Release or Stroke (which is same as a Press followed by Release ). var usbClientSetting = new UsbClientSetting() { ManufactureName = \"Manufacture_Name\", ProductName = \"Product_Name\", SerialNumber = \"serialnumber\", }; var usbclientController = UsbClientController.GetDefault(); var kb = new Keyboard(usbclientController, usbClientSetting); var key = new Key[] { Key.G, Key.H, Key.I, Key.Space, Key.E, Key.L, Key.E, Key.C, Key.T, Key.R, Key.O, Key.N, Key.I, Key.C, Key.S }; kb.Enable(); while (kb.DeviceState != DeviceState.Configured) Thread.Sleep(100);// wait or use events kb.Press(Key.LeftShift);// hold shift down for (var i = 0; i < key.Length; i++) { kb.Stroke(key[i]); Thread.Sleep(500);// type it twice a second } kb.Release(Key.LeftShift);// release shift USB Joystick Devices running TinyCLR OS can simulate a Joystick. var usbclientController = UsbClientController.GetDefault(); var usbClientSetting = new UsbClientSetting() { ManufactureName = \"Manufacture_Name\", ProductName = \"Product_Name\", SerialNumber = \"serialnumber\", }; var joystick = new Joystick(usbclientController, usbClientSetting); joystick.DeviceStateChanged += UsbClientDeviceStateChanged; joystick.Enable(); Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); //... void UsbClientDeviceStateChanged(RawDevice sender, DeviceState state) { if (state == DeviceState.Configured) { new Thread(() => { Joystick joystick = (Joystick)sender; while (true) { joystick.PressButton(0); Thread.Sleep(500); joystick.ReleaseButton(0); Thread.Sleep(1000); } }).Start(); } } PC Data Transfer This feature is used to transfer data between the hardware and a PC. See PC Data Comm for details. USB Raw For advanced users, virtually any type of USB device can be created using USB Raw.

    "keywords": "USB PC Communication These protocols facilitate communication between the SITCore device and a PC. The USB page has more details and is a prerequisite to this tutorial. By default, USB client support is used for deploying and debugging applications. However, deploying and debugging can be switched to a serial mode using MOD pin, freeing the USB Client port to serve other purposes. The USB port can also be freed by completely disabling the USB debug interface, which is a feature of ip protection . USB CDC The USB Communications Device Class (CDC) is natively supported by Windows and Linux. It is a way for a PC to use a USB port as a virtual serial port. Once loaded, the PC will use this port like any other serial port (COM port). Windows 10 works without the need for any drivers, but earlier operating systems may need a driver. While it works with most operating systems, CDC is typically limited to 64 KBytes/second. Tip Needed NuGets: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.UsbClient var usbclientController = UsbClientController.GetDefault(); var usbClientSetting = new UsbClientSetting(){ Mode = UsbClientMode.Cdc, ManufactureName = \"Manufacture_Name\", ProductName = \"Product_Name\", SerialNumber = \"12345678\", }; var cdc = new Cdc(usbclientController, usbClientSetting); cdc.DeviceStateChanged += (a,b) => Debug.WriteLine(\"Connection changed.\"); cdc.DataReceived += (a,count) => Debug.WriteLine(\"Data received:\" + count); cdc.Enable(); while (cdc.DeviceState != DeviceState.Configured); Debug.WriteLine(\"UsbClient Connected\"); // The example will read data from port to dataR array // Copy dataR to dataW array, plus 1 for each element // Write dataW array back to port while (true){ var len = cdc.Stream.BytesToRead; if (len > 0){ var dataR = new byte[len]; var dataW = new byte[len]; int read = cdc.Stream.Read(dataR); for (var i = 0; i < read; i++){ dataW[i] = (byte)(dataR[i] + 1); } cdc.Stream.Write(dataW); } Thread.Sleep(100); } WinUSB The WinUSB drivers are unique to Windows and take advantage of the power and speed of USB to provide faster communication than CDC. The speed is limited by the data processing on the IoT device. Windows 10 loads the drivers automatically, Windows 7 requires drivers. Note Unlike CDC mode, a disadvantage of WinUSB is that it requires a special code on the PC side to read and write to the device. var usbclientController = UsbClientController.GetDefault(); var usbClientSetting = new UsbClientSetting(){ Mode = UsbClientMode.WinUsb, ManufactureName = \"Manufacture_Name\", ProductName = \"Product_Name\", SerialNumber = \"12345678\", Guid = \"{your guid}\", }; var winUsb = new WinUsb(usbclientController, usbClientSetting); winUsb.DeviceStateChanged += (a,b) => Debug.WriteLine(\"Connection changed.\"); winUsb.DataReceived += (a,count) => Debug.WriteLine(\"Data received:\" + count); winUsb.Enable(); while (winUsb.DeviceState != DeviceState.Configured) ; Debug.WriteLine(\"UsbClient Connected\"); // The example will read data from port to dataR array // Copy dataR to dataW array, plus 1 for each element // Write dataW array back to port while (true){ var len = winUsb.Stream.BytesToRead; if (len > 0){ var dataR = new byte[len]; var dataW = new byte[len]; int read = winUsb.Stream.Read(dataR); for (var i = 0; i < read; i++){ dataW[i] = (byte)(dataR[i] + 1); } winUsb.Stream.Write(dataW); } Thread.Sleep(100); } WebUSB Some modern browsers, like Chrome and Edge, include a way to give access to the USB from the web content. TinyCLR CDC and WinUSB already include the necessary descriptors to enable WebUSB. This repo includes a full WebUSBApp and SerialWebUSBApp examples to load onto the device, that is any TinyCLR device. Once loaded, visit https://ghi-electronics.github.io/TinyCLR-WebUSB/ to connect to the device. Note For CDC (Serial Web USB), needs to load SerialWebUSBApp into the device and visit https://ghi-electronics.github.io/TinyCLR-WebUSB/serialwebusb.html User will see TinyCLR WebUsb device as an option to Connect On successful connection the input drop downs are enabled. After selecting Update State the device sends back a message indicating the outcome. In this case the PB0 is set HIGH and the LED turns on. The secret sauce is in using the correct endpoints, which are fixed in both CDC and WinUSB drivers. This line can be used to initiate the class let webusb = new WebUSB(2, 1); which is found inside webusb.js file"

There are many available standard elements, and you can make your own custom elements as well. All elements descend from the UIElement class. Explore the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.UI.Controls namespace to see what's available. For the sake of simplifying the rest of this tutorial, we've added the private static UIElement Elements() method that creates and returns the elements. This is then assigned to the child of our window. You will need to add window.Child = Elements() right before returning from CreateWindow . Tip This example needs a font . private static UIElement Elements() { var txt = new TextBox { Font = font, Text = \"Hello World!\", HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center, VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center }; return txt; } TextBox The TextBox allows for both single line and multiple line text input. var textBox = new TextBox() { Text = \"This is TextBox\", Font = fontB, Width = 120, Height = 25, HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center, VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center, }; Panel A Window can carry only a single Child , that is a single element. This is not a concern because the single element can be a container, like a Panel , which holds multiple elements. You can even have panels within panels with each having its own elements. This example will introduce shapes found in the GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.UI.Shapes namespace. It also shows an example of the TextBox element. We will also set margins for a better look. private static UIElement Elements() { var panel = new Panel(); var txt1 = new TextBox() { HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left, VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top, }; txt1.Font = font; txt1.SetMargin(20); txt1.Text = \"Hello World!\"; var txt2 = new Text(font, \"TinyCLR is Great!\") { ForeColor = Colors.White, HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Right, }; txt2.SetMargin(20); var rect = new Rectangle(200, 10) { Fill = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green), HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center, }; panel.Children.Add(txt1); panel.Children.Add(txt2); panel.Children.Add(rect); return panel; } StackPanel There are also two types of elements that descend from panels, Canvas and StackPanel . The Canvas control allows elements to be added anywhere. StackPanels, on the other hand, place elements in order. We will modify the previous example to use a vertical StackPanel. The elements will stack and be arranged to the right and the left. Note that setting vertical alignment will be ignored as the vertical StackPanel overrides how elements are stacked. private static UIElement Elements() { var panel = new StackPanel(Orientation.Vertical); var txt1 = new TextBox() { HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left, VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top, }; txt1.Font = font; txt1.SetMargin(20); txt1.Text = \"Hello World!\"; var txt2 = new Text(font, \"TinyCLR is Great!\") { ForeColor = Colors.White, HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Right, }; txt2.SetMargin(20); var rect = new Rectangle(200, 10) { Fill = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green), HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center, }; panel.Children.Add(txt1); panel.Children.Add(txt2); panel.Children.Add(rect); return panel; } Canvas The Canvas element provides pixel level control over the placement of its child controls. The Width and Height properties of Canvas are requested dimensions, but the actual size depends on the size of the parent element. The ActualWidth and ActualHeight properties can be used to determine the actual size of the Canvas. Controls within a Canvas are positioned relative to the four edges of the Canvas. private static UIElement Elements() { var canvas = new Canvas(); var txt = new Text(font, \"TinyCLR is Great!\") { ForeColor = Colors.White, }; var rect = new Rectangle(150, 30) { Fill = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green), HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center, }; Canvas.SetLeft(rect, 20); Canvas.SetBottom(rect, 20); canvas.Children.Add(rect); Canvas.SetLeft(txt, 30); Canvas.SetBottom(txt, 25); canvas.Children.Add(txt); return canvas; } Border This element defines a border inside another element. The position of child elements is constrained to the area inside the border. In this example the border thickness is set to 10, but if the children do not fill the area within the border, the border's thickness will automatically increase. Uncomment the two alignment lines to see an undesired effect of how borders work. private static UIElement Elements() { var border = new Border(); border.SetBorderThickness(10); border.BorderBrush = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Red) var txt = new TextBox() { //HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center, //VerticalAlignment= VerticalAlignment.Center, }; txt.Font = font; txt.Text = \"TinyCLR is Great!\"; border.Child = txt; return border; } The fix is to add a container and then the container will have a border. In this example, the parent of the border is the canvas instead of the window. private static UIElement Elements() { var canvas = new Canvas(); var border = new Border(); border.SetBorderThickness(10); border.BorderBrush = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Red); Canvas.SetLeft(border, 20); Canvas.SetTop(border, 20); var txt = new TextBox(); txt.Font = font; txt.Text = \"TinyCLR is Great!\"; border.Child = txt; canvas.Children.Add(border); return canvas; } Button Buttons are simple controls that accept user input in the form of a click, which in embedded devices is usually a finger tap on a touch screen. The button needs a child, typically text, which describes the button's function. Buttons have a Click event to respond to user input. private static UIElement Elements() { var txt = new Text(font, \"Push me!\") { VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center, HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center, }; var button = new Button() { Child = txt, Width = 100, Height = 40, }; button.Click += Button_Click; return button; } private static void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { // Add button click event code here... } TextFlow TextFlow is a more powerful version of TextBlock that supports more advanced text formatting, and works well with large blocks of text. private static UIElement Elements() { var textFlow = new TextFlow(); textFlow.TextRuns.Add(\"Hello \", font, Colors.Red); textFlow.TextRuns.Add(\"World!\", font, Colors.Purple); textFlow.TextRuns.Add(TextRun.EndOfLine); textFlow.TextRuns.Add(\"TinyCLR is Great!\", font, Colors.Yellow); return textFlow; } ListBox This element provides a list of options for users to select from. private static UIElement Elements() { var listBox = new ListBox(); listBox.Items.Add(new Text(font, \"Item 1\")); listBox.Items.Add(new Text(font, \"Item 2\")); listBox.Items.Add(new Text(font, \"Item 3\")); listBox.Items.Add(new Text(font, \"Item 4\")); return listBox; } It is also possible to add a separator between items, simply by using a rectangle. This item will be set to be not selectable. private static UIElement Elements() { var rect = new Rectangle() { Height = 1, Width=30, Stroke = new Pen(Colors.Black), }; var separator = new ListBoxItem() { Child = rect, IsSelectable = false, }; separator.SetMargin(2); var listBox = new ListBox(); listBox.Items.Add(new Text(font, \"Item 1\")); listBox.Items.Add(new Text(font, \"Item 2\")); listBox.Items.Add(separator); listBox.Items.Add(new Text(font, \"Item 3\")); listBox.Items.Add(new Text(font, \"Item 4\")); return listBox; } ScrollViewer The scroll viewer allows for viewing content that is larger than the viewing area. User input is used to shift the content within the viewing area. // Create a scrollviewer var scrollViewer = new ScrollViewer { Background = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Gray), // scroll line by line with 10 pixels per line ScrollingStyle = ScrollingStyle.LineByLine, LineWidth = 10, LineHeight = 10 }; Register Touch event, items in scrollViewer will go up or down every time touched. scrollViewer.TouchUp += ScrollViewer_TouchUp; private void ScrollViewer_TouchUp(object sender, GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.UI.Input.TouchEventArgs e) { var s = (ScrollViewer)sender; s.LineDown(); } The Dispatcher The User Interface libraries rely on a dispatcher to handle system events and update invalidated elements. All elements are changed and updated from within the dispatcher. In this example, we will show the time on the screen. The time will be in a text box that is updated every second using a Timer . Since timers run in their own thread, a dispatcher invoke is needed. static void Counter(object o) { Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1), _ => { Text txt = (Text)o; txt.TextContent = DateTime.Now.ToString(); txt.Invalidate(); return null; }, null); } private static UIElement Elements() { var txt = new Text(font, \"Hello World!\") { ForeColor = Colors.White, VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center, HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center, }; Timer timer = new Timer(Counter, txt, 2000, 1000); return txt; } You can also use the dispatcher timer directly: private static UIElement Elements() { var txt = new Text(font, \"Hello World!\") { ForeColor = Colors.White, VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center, HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center, }; var timer = new DispatcherTimer(); timer.Tag = txt; timer.Tick += Counter; timer.Interval = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 1); timer.Start(); return txt; } private static void Counter(object sender, EventArgs e) { var txt = (Text)((DispatcherTimer)sender).Tag; txt.TextContent = DateTime.Now.ToString(); txt.Invalidate(); } User Input A user can feed input to the graphical interface through touch or button input. app.InputProvider.RaiseTouch(x, y, touchState, DateTime.UtcNow); app.InputProvider.RaiseButton(btn, btnState, DateTime.UtcNow); The touch tutorial has further details."

    "keywords": "Watchdog A watchdog timer is used to reset the system if the system fails or locks up. During normal operation, the application will regularly reset the watchdog timer so it never reaches zero and doesn't reset the system. Note Once Watchdog is enabled it can't be disabled without resetting the system or a power cycle. Tip Needed NuGets: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Watchdog It's recommend to run Watchdog inside a thread in the application. new Thread(RunWatchDog).Start(); static void RunWatchDog() { // Set watchdog to 5 seconds and reset it every 4 seconds var WatchDog = WatchdogController.GetDefault(); WatchDog.Enable(5000); while (true) { //reset the timer WatchDog.Reset(); Thread.Sleep(4000); } } Tip Set your Watchdog timer to a reasonable amount of time, setting it too low will cause the application to constantly reset. Note Enabling the watchdog timer when debugging is a bad idea since the system will probably reset while stepping through code."

    "keywords": "WiFi SITCore line of products includes native support for the Microchip ATWINC1500 series of WiFi modules. These modules are available pre-certified from FCC, CE, and other regulatory agencies. For added security, WiFi module communication is handled through SPI, not through AT commands. Important To take security to the next level, all network cryptography and security are done internally inside SITCore and not inside the WiFi module, meaning the data going over SPI is all encrypted and secure. Supported Modules ATWINC1500 & 1510 both work identically with SITCore, except the 1510 has more memory that SITCore doesn't need. The part number with the correct firmware that has been tested with TinyCLR is ATWINC1500-MR210PB. A module with a different firmware version can still be used, but a firmware update becomes necessary. Using the exact version eliminates the need for this step. Sample Code The sample code is meant for the FEZ Portal with it's built in WiFi module. If you want to use a bare ATWINC1500 module instead, you'll need to connect interrupt, reset, and chip select lines in addition to the SPI lines (MOSI, MISO, SCK). The user can overide the WiFi built-in MAC address, but not recommended. Important If using WiFi 7 click module, there is an enable pin which needs to be pulled high.

Such as getting the WiFi module's MAC address, getting RSSI (Relative Signal Strength Indicator), scanning for access points, checking the firmware version, and over-the-air (OTA) firmware update. Tip Needed NuGets: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Drivers.Microchip.Winc15x0 SetCommunicationInterfaceSettings function needs to be called before using this driver. //Scan for WiFi access points: string[] ssidList = Winc15x0Interface.Scan(); //Get Relative Signal Strength Indicator for the connected access point: int signalStrength = Winc15x0Interface.GetRssi(); //Get the WiFi module's MAC address: byte[] macAddress = Winc15x0Interface.GetMacAddress(); //Get the version of the installed WiFi firmware: string fwVersion = Winc15x0Interface.GetFirmwareVersion(); //Print a list of WiFi firmware versions that have been tested with TinyCLR OS. // Note: Untested WiFi firmware versions may also work. for (int i = 0; i < Winc15x0Interface.FirmwareSupports.Length; i++) { System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(\"Supported firmware version #\" + (i + 1).ToString() + \": \" + Winc15x0Interface.FirmwareSupports[i].ToString()); } //Download and install firmware from an OTA download (web) server: // Must upload firmware file to root folder in server // (e.g. http://192.168.0.100/m2m_ota_3a0.bin). bool otaUpdate = Winc15x0Interface.FirmwareUpdate(\"http://192.168.0.100/m2m_ota_3a0.bin\", TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(5000)); Multicast IP Multicast works as expected on all other network interfaces; however, in order to achieve this on WiFi, we need to convert a Multicast IP to a multicast MAC Address. Any online tool like this can be used. This capture shows Multicast IP address 239.255.255.254 for example. This Multicast MAC address is then used as below. Winc15x0Interface.AddMulticastMacAddress(new byte[] {​​​​​​​​ 0x01, 0x00, 0x5e, 0x7f, 0xff, 0xfe }​​​​​​​​); If more than one Multicast MAC address is needed, just call AddMulticastMacAddress multiple time. There is also an API allows remove multicast mac address from the list as well. Winc15x0Interface.RemoveMulticastMacAddress(new byte[] {​​​​​​​​ 0x01, 0x00, 0x5e, 0x7f, 0xff, 0xfe }​​​​​​​​); Tip Needed NuGets: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Drivers.Microchip.Winc15x0 AccessPoint SITCore devices can be set up as a WiFi AccessPoint . This creates a 1-to-1 connection between SITCore and other hardware devices through WiFi without the need to connect to a switch. An example might be, connecting a phone directly to the SITCore hardware. This may be necessary in some situations where access to a network isn't possible and a user needs to connect to the device directly. Tip AccessPoint only supports connecting to one device at a time. Setting up a device as an access point works just like the default Station mode except the Ssid and now the one the device is broadcasting. var networkInterfaceSetting = new WiFiNetworkInterfaceSettings() { Ssid = \"Your SSID\", Password = \"Your Password\", Mode = WiFiMode.AccessPoint, }; Tip Only WEP password security is supported. Do not set the Password for an open network. AccessPoint can provide an IP address to the connected device when networkInterfaceSetting.DhcpEnabled = true; through a simple internal DHCP server. If desired, an event is triggered on completion. WiFiNetworkInterfaceSettings wifiSettings = new WiFiNetworkInterfaceSettings() { Ssid = \"Your SSID\", Password = \"Your Password\", }; //... WiFiNetworkInterfaceSettings wifiSettings.AccessPointClientConnectionChanged += (a, b, c) => { Debug.WriteLine(\"Provided IP = \" + b.ToString()); Debug.WriteLine(\"Connected device's MAC Address = \" + c); }; The usual connection event is fired just like in Station mode, except in this case it is fired when an external device is connected NetworkController.NetworkLinkConnectedChanged ."
