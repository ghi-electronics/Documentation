The Transport The host connects to a due device using a standard USB connection. All the necessary USB descriptors are built in a standard manner that no drivers are necessary. Once a device is plugged in, the host (computer, phone, Windows, Android, Mac...etc.) will detect and enable a new serial port. The library will then use this serial port to communicate with the DUE-enabled device. On Windows, the device manager can be used to see a list of available serial ports. Troubleshooting The DUE console is the perfect place to connect and verify functionality. The first thing to do when facing any troubles is making sure the device is loaded with the latest firmware.

This allows the device to run standalone independent from any host. This very easy-to-learn scripting language is inspired by BASIC and Python, giving the user the simplicity and flexibility they need. The on-line DUE Console lets developers start experimenting with DUE Script and the physical world in minutes...no installation is necessary! Operating Modes DUE Script has two modes Immediate mode and Record mode. Immediate mode commands are executed immediately. Immediate mode commands are a single line of code. Record mode commands are stored in flash and then can be executed. The DUE Console handles these modes automatically. The following details are only needed when not using DUE Console, like when using a terminal software like TeraTerm. Immediate Mode The > command is used to switch the system to immediate mode. This in turn will change the prompt to > as well. All statements are executed as soon as entered. > Print(\"Hello World\") Note Immediate Mode is the default mode when device is first connected. Record Mode The Record mode, is entered using the $ command. This will also modify the prompt to $. All statements entered are stored internally and not executed. The run command can be used to execute the program. The device will also automatically run a program on power up. Statement Description $ Sets the device in record mode > Exits record mode and returns to direct mode The following statements control the program recorded in flash, but can be used in both Immediate or Record modes. When used in Record mode these special statements execute, but are not added to the program in flash. Statement Description Run Executes the program stored in flash New Erases the program stored in flash List Returns all the code in your program Tip A running program can be terminated by hitting the ESC key, DEL Key, or Backspace Key. > $ $ PrintLn (x) $ PrintLn (y) $ > > x=1:y=2 > Run 1 2 >List PrintLn(x) PrintLn(y) >new Note The DUE Console hides the prompts and automatically switches to the appropriate mode. Script Features DUE Scripts are not case sensitive. Its syntax is very simple and inspired by BASIC coding language. The power of DUE Scripts comes from its simplicity rather than from its feature set. This is a perfect language to teach someone coding. Users that require serious coding should be using the DUE Platform combined with one of the many available coding languages. Still, DUE Scripts can be used to extend those languages, as detailed below. Print Print() is a function that returns the value of its arguments. These arguments can be variables, strings, or equations. Print() is also unique because it can handle multiple arguments. x=100 Print(x) Print(\"Hello World\") Print(x+x) Print(x,\"Hello World\", x+x) Result: 100Hello World200100Hello World 200 PrintLn() adds a line break to each print statement. x=100 PrintLn(x) PrintLn(\"Hello World\") PrintLn(x+x) PrintLn(x,\"Hello World\", x+x) Result: 100 Hello World 200 100Hello World200 Comments The # character is used to identify a comment. Comments are ignored by the program, text added to help developers understand the code. # This is a comment x=10 Print(x) # This is also a comment Variables DUE Script has a fixed set of 26 variables, one for each letter, assigned to a to z. The only data type used in DUE is float. All variables created are global in nature. To use a variable, simply use x=5.5 Operands DUE Script supports the following operators. Mathematical + Add - Subtract * Multiply / Divide % Modulus, the remainder Comparators > Greater Than < Less Than >= Greater Than or Equal To <= Less Than or Equal To = Equal != Not Equal Logical && And || Or Bitwise & Bitwise And | Bitwise Or << Shift Right >> Shift Left Arrays Similarly to variables, arrays are fixed to 26 arrays. They are assigned to letters a to z. DUE Script differentiates between variable a and array a[] when square brackets are used. Arrays are size zero by default and can be sized, or resized using Dim. This is an example that uses both, variables and arrays: Dim a[10] For i=0 to 9:a[i]=i*2:Next For i=0 to 9:PrintLn(a[i]):Next The output will look like: 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Tip Use Dim a[0] to free up the memory reserved for array a[]. For-Loop The For-Loop has two different syntax styles. BASIC and Python style. BASIC Style The BASIC style For-Loop includes the last number in the range. # Counting Up For i=1 to 5 Print(i,\",\") Next Output: 0,1,2,3,4,5, Incremental For-Loops # Counting Up in increments of 10 For i=1000 to 1 Step 10 PrintLn(i) Next # Counting Down in increments of 10 For i=1000 to 1 Step -10 PrintLn(i) Next Python Style DUE Script also allows For Loops written similar to Python. The last number of the range is not included in output. # Range with only stop value For i in range(5) Print(i,\",\") next Output: 0,1,2,3,4, Incremental For-Loops # Range with start and stop value For i in range(1,5) Print(i,\",\") next # Range with start, stop, and step value For i in range(1,5,2) Print(i,\",\") next # Range with start, stop, and negative step value For i in range(10,1,-2) Print(i,\",\") next If-Statement If-Statements must end with the End command. This will only end the If-Statement and not your program. If x=1 PrintLn(\"one\") Else PrintLn(\"not one\") End If-Statements can also be nested within each other. Each If-Statement requires an End command to terminate its own process. If x=1 PrintLn(\"one\") Else If x =2 PrintLn(\"two\") Else PrintLn(\"not one or two\") End End Labels Labels are needed to redirect the program. They are used by Goto and when calling a subroutine. A Label is created by using the @ symbol in front of the desired label. Labels are limited to 6 characters. Goto Goto is useful for repeating tasks indefinitely by sending to a specific Label name. @Loop # add code here that runs forever Goto Loop Exit & Return Exit terminates the program. Print(\"Hello\") Exit Print(\"This will not get printed\") Return send the execution back from a called subroutine, see Subroutines below. Subroutine Developers can use Labels to create their own subroutines to implement \"soft\" like functions in their code. These subroutines are similar to functions but do not take variables or return values. Tip The built-in API offers true functions and therefore do take arguments and return values. User subroutines are always added in recoding mode and resides in nonvolatile memory. A user subroutine starts with a label and ends with a Return. @Mine # add code here Return The subroutine can then be called by its name followed by (). Mine() Note how a subroutine can be called externally from Immediate Mode. This allows for extending DUE Scripts with new commands that can then later be called from Immediate Mode and in turn be called from a high level language, like Python, when connected to a Host. Tip DUE variables are global and any changes inside subroutines will affect variable values outside those subroutines. Combining Commands Multiple commands can be combined on a single line. This is especially useful when using Immediate mode where a single line is required. To use multiple command, a : symbol is used. This is an example of a for loop in a single line For i=1 to 1000 Step 10:PrintLn(i):Next Good Practices Recorded DUE Scripts are executed immediately on power up (the run command is issued internally). If the user doesn't want any of the code to run, they can start the program with an Exit statement. And then the 'Exit' can be flowed by a label, for example '@Go'. This code can be saved to the device using Record Mode: Exit @Go Print(\"Only when Go!\") The program will not execute on power up due to the Exit command. But now calling Go() in immediate mode will produce \"Only when Go!\". Another good practice is to use the on-board LED as an activity LED to show that the device is running. Simply start your program by adding Led(200,200,-1)."

    "keywords": "NeoPixel 16x16 Matrix These samples uses NeoPixel. NeoPixel is an addressable LED that actually contains 3 LEDs, RED, GREEN, and BLUE. These three LEDs combine to make just about any color. NeoPixel come in many different configurations, from 1 single NeoPixel to panels containing many. DUE allows for up to 256 NeoPixel. This is perfect for a 16x16 setup. Hardware: Any device supporting DUE-Script NeoPixel 16x16 Matrix with zig-zag matrix configuration Set-up: Connecting the panel is easy, we just need to connect three wires POWER, GND, and DATA to control all the LEDs. On the back of most NEOPixel panels are 3 sets of cables connected to the panel. OUT: connector is used to connect panels together. POWER: is used to connect 5V external power source to the panel. This is often necessary when using many LEDs. IN: connector is where we connect our hardware to the NeoPixel. We connect PIN 1 DUE enabled hardware to the wire labeled DIN, in this case the wire is the green wire. Add a picture frame: We took 2 5x7\" picture frames and connected the longer ends together to make a picture frame to hold our NeoPixel. We even used the back of the picture frames as a built-in stand.

For example, when updating a display using I2C. This is where streams come in handy. Provided libraries, such as Python, use streams internally whenever possible. A stream command initiates the request, such as LcdStream(). Once this command is received and accepted by the device, the & symbol will be returned indicating readiness. The host can now send the entire data, exactly to the required byte count. See the individual stream command for details on what data count and structure to be sent. Streams in DUE Script Streams are not used when coding DUE Script directly. They are utilized by the provided libraries, when used in hosted mode."
