# Streams

---

DUE Link APIs are built to be ASCII human-friendly. This works great from the [DUE Console](../console.md) for example. However, there are instances where speed is required. For example, when updating a display. Also, there are instances where raw binary data is desired instead of ASCII. For example, when sending data over a data bus. This is where streams come in handy.

A stream command initiates the request, for example `LcdStream()`. Once this command is received and accepted by the device, the `&` symbol will be returned. Now, the host can send the entire data, exactly to the required byte count. This required count and format, to follow the stream command, is documented with each stream command individual. 

Streams are not used when coding DUE directly, like when using the DUE Console. And the provided libraries, like for Python, uses streams internally. This page is only provided as a further reference.
