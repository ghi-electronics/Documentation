# DUE - Universal API

---

The universal functions of DUE are available on all DUE-supported [hardware](/hardware/intro.md), for user defined functions, see the [Dynamic](../dynamic/dynamic.md) section

> [!TIP]
> DUE is not case sensitive. Code samples found here use upper and lower case to make things look clearer. Print("DUE") is exactly the same as print("DUE")
