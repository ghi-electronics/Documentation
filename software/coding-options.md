The DUE Platform ships with multiple supported languages. Users interested in supporting other languages can convert one of the open-source libraries (such as Python) to their language of choice.

Tip: this page talks about supported languages running on computers. DUE Platform also includes DUE Script allowing a DUE-enabled hardware to ruin independently.
