C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that has been around for many years.

The support for C++ is incomplete and only provided as a reference for those interested in exploring the possibilities.

An example can be found on the GitHub [DUELink Samples](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/due-samples/tree/main/Demo/CPP) Repo.
