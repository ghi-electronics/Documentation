A DUE-Link-powered device is an extension to the connected host. Any language with access to serial port (virtual USB) has access to the hardware. There are samples for language with a basic simple demo and there are complete libraries provided for some other languages.

All the source codes for the demos are located at https://github.com/ghi-electronics/due-samples. The provided libraries are also open source, located at https://github.com/ghi-electronics/due-libraries
