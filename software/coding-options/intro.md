> [!NOTE]
> This section talks about supported languages running on a host (computer, table, phone...etc.). [DUELink Engine](../engine/intro.md) also includes [DUE Script](../engine/script.md) allowing a DUELink-enabled hardware to run stand-alone.

## Open Source

Libraries for the supported languages are provided open-source and found at the [DUELink Libraries](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/due-libraries) repo. We invite you to learn more about the internal workings of [DUELink Engine](../engine/intro.md) and also invite you to support additional systems and languages. 

Also, check out the many provided [samples](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/due-samples).
