Swift can be used to give you physical access on MacOS devices.


The support for SWIFT is incomplete and only provided as a reference for those interested in exploring the possibilities.

An example can be found on the GitHub [DUELink Samples](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/due-samples/tree/main/Demo/MacOS) Repo.
