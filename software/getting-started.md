**Hardware Selection**

The first step is to pick from one of the many available [DUE Hardware](../hardware/intro.md) options. Which includes the Maker friendly FEZ(Fast & Easy) and STEM educational BrainPad. Follow the instructions to load the latest firmware get the hardware ready. 

**Start Coding**

We recommend starting out with the web-based [DUE Console](./../software/console.md)  as it requires nothing to install. Connect your device and you are ready to start coding. Try to enter `DWrite('L',1)` in the immediate text box turn the LED on.

Next, you may want to start experimenting with one of your favorite [Coding Options](../software/coding-options/coding-options.md).

Some of the coding options include full [open-source libraries](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/due-libraries) for easier use. However, all coding options include demos to get you started. Check out the many provided [open-source samples](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/due-samples). The JavaScript sample demo is alive and can be tested now at 
[demo.duelink.com](https://demo.duelink.com/)
