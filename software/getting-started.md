## Hardware

The first step is to pick from one of the many available [**DUE Hardware**](../hardware/intro.md) options. Follow the instructions to get the hardware ready. 

## Software

Once the firmware is loaded onto your device you are ready to start coding [**DUE Script**](../software/due-script/due-script.md).

The [**DUE Console**](../software/console.md) web IDE is a great place to start and familiarize yourself with the [**DUE API**](due-script/corelib/corelib.md)

If you're a developer or educator that is already coding you can use one of the many [**Coding Options**](../software/coding-options/coding-options.md) available.
