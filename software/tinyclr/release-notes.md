- MAC addressing has changed. Ethernet and ENC always require a MAC address, WiFi MAC address is optional, PPP needs no MAC address.
- Fixed Thread.Sleep() adding 2 ms when not debugging.
- Fixed USB and SD card not working at the same time.

#### Known Issues
- User can access QSPI pins even when QSPI is active for deployment.
- Networking won't work correctly if WiFi scan is called after `Network.Enable()`.
- WiFi scan always adds a blank SSID at the end of the list.
- Drawing on screen may be slower when network that uses SPI is running (WiFi, ENC28).
- In Visual Studio, the application doesn't start automatically when trying to `Start Without Debugging` (CTRL+F5). Resetting the board will start the application.
- The PJ0 interrupt configuration changes when the device is reset with the reset button, but there is no problem when power cycling the board.

### Drivers

#### Changes
- Fixed issue of intermittent noise coming from OV9655 camera modules.

#### Known Issues
- None.

#### Known Issues
- JSON does not work in some cases.
- When drawing to SSD1351 displays, you may have to add ten to the x coordinate for the screen position to be correct.
- The OV9655 camera can intermittently have a noisy picture. Resetting the board should fix the problem.

#### Known Issues
- None

### TinyCLR Font Converter

#### Changes
- None.

#### Known Issues
- None.

### Firmware

#### Changes
- Signal generator has been improved and can now generate signals of up to 1.25 MHz in frequency.
- Fixed SPI locking up networking.
- Fixed bug when sharing SPI bus with multiple devices.
- Fixed incorrect timestamping of events.
- Added support for microcontroller temperature sensor.
- Added support for VBAT voltage monitoring.
- Added support for ADC internal reference voltage.
- Fixed I2C bug with messages larger than 255 bytes.
- Corrected I2C clock bug.
- Added support for wake up from RTC alarm.

- When using static IP addressing, after disconnecting the device from an Ethernet network the old IP address will still be assigned instead of 0.0.0.0.
- Graphics.DrawString() with native displays on the SC20260B may stop WiFi.
