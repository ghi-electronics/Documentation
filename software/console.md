# DUE Console

The DUE Console provides many functionalities. It is a great start to verify the device is functioning properly. It is also a great place to learn about and use [DUE Scripts](due-script/due-script.md) and take advantage of the versatile [DUE core libraries](due-script/corelib/corelib.md)
