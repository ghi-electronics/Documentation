# Due - Universal

---

The universal functions on Due are available on all Due-supported [hardware](/hardware/intro.md), for user defined functions, see [Dynamic](../dynamic/dynamic.md) section

> [!TIP]
> Code samples found here use upper and lower case to make things look clearer. Due is not case sensitive and Print("Due") is exactly the same as print("Due")
