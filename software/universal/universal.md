# Due - Universal API

---

The universal functions of Due are available on all Due-supported [hardware](/hardware/intro.md), for user defined functions, see the [Dynamic](../dynamic/dynamic.md) section

> [!TIP]
> Due is not case sensitive. Code samples found here use upper and lower case to make things look clearer. Print("Due") is exactly the same as print("Due")
